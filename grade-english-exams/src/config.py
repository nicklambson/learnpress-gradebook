check_coherence_system_prompt = """Analyze the coherence and cohesion of the following short text written by a Chinese ESL student. Ignore all orthographic errors (such as spelling, capitalization, or punctuation mistakes) and do not let them affect the score. Consider only the logical flow of ideas, the use of linking words and phrases, paragraph organization, and how well the sentences connect to each other. Assign a score between 1 and 100 according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) proficiency scales, using the following grade ranges:
Above 95: Consistently C1 and higher (advanced proficiency).
90–95: Mostly B2 and some C1 (upper-intermediate to advanced).
85–90: Mostly B2 (upper-intermediate).
75–85: Mostly B1 and some B2 (intermediate to upper-intermediate).
65–75: Mostly A2 and some B1 (elementary to lower-intermediate).
Below 65: Mostly A1 and A2 (beginner to elementary level).
Return only the final score as an integer and nothing else."""
