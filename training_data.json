During this period, there is a great surge in the quality of people's life. We can know more details about inequality from an elephant chat presented by Branco Milanovic, a Serbian-American economist. \nFrom this chart, we can see three dramatic points. The top of the elephant head implies the global middle class, whose incomes increase the most. Most of them were in Asia. They left farm for city and had a better life.\nAt the same time, the working class in US, Germany and Japan, although they still made a fair amount of money compared to the rest of the world, their incomes did not improve. So they are the losers of globalization. Those developed countries gave opportunities to the global middle class for their workers. From my perspective, that's the main reasons why global middle class are the winners of globalization, while the working class of developed nations are losers.\n\n\n"

Why?\n\nThe global middle class are the winners of globalization, while the working class of developed nations are the losers.\n\nThe world economy did not grow so quickly until late 1700s-early 1800s and it reached a fever pitch in the 1800s and 1900s. During this period, there was a great surge in the quality of people's life. We can know more details about inequality from an elephant chart presented by Branco Milanovic, a Serbian-American economist. \nFrom this chart, we can see three dramatic points. The top of the elephant head represents the global middle class, whose incomes increased the most. The majority of the global middle class were in Asia. They left farm for city and had a better life.\nAt the same time, although still relatively fair, the incomes of the working class in the US, Germany and Japan, did not improve. So they are the losers of globalization. Plutocrats in developed countries outsourced opportunities from their own workers to workers in China and India. From my perspective, these are the main reasons why the global middle class are the winners of globalization, while the working class of developed nations are the losers.\n\n\n"

Then the translation engine divides them into smaller pieces and calculate the frequency of the piece in both source texts and target texts. In this way, when we ask statistical MT to translate texts or sentences, it is not really doing translating but present the result of the highest frequency.

In this process, neural translation engine gradually learns translation rules and improves the translation result after thousands or hundreds of thousands of failures.  I think that's the reason why neural MT is data-sensitive and underperforms SMT with long sentences. Just like children, if they learn more, they perform better.

In marriage, so understood, partners seek emotional fulfillment, and remain as long as they find it.\nNo matter which view, people have their own considerations and opinions. There is no absolute wrong or right, the only difference is the way people look at it.\n  \n\n"

This year, many manufacturers and customers in the industry will participate in this meeting. In combination with the current situation, the number of operations in hospitals around the country has increased rapidly, so we need to expand new customers as soon as possible and seize industry opportunities. Through this meeting, I will meet many new customers and explore some new market opportunities, which will be of great help to the performance growth of subsequent companies. So I think it is necessary to attend this conference.\nThis conference will be held at the Pudong International Conference Center on April 15. I plan to fly from Beijing to Shanghai one day in advance. In order to get to the meeting place conveniently, I will book a hotel near the meeting place. At present, the hotel accommodation fee is still within the company's travel standard. The meeting ended on April 16. I plan to fly back to Beijing that afternoon. The whole trip is three days and two nights, and the estimated cost is about 5000 yuan.

Hope everything goes well recently.I am writing this letter because I want to participate in the product exposition to be held in Shanghai on the 15th of next month. \n\nThe meeting time is the 15th to 19th of the next month. I will arrive on the 14th and return to the company on the 20th. There will be a weekend holiday in the middle. The main expenses of the Expo include RMB 10,000 of booth expenses, RMB 3,000 of transportation expenses and RMB 7,000 of accommodation expenses. I hope that this cost can get the financial support of the company. I hope you can agree with me to participate in the Expo for the following reasons:\nFirst of all, we can really contact customers, establish direct contact with customers, make face-to-face explanations with customers, quickly and clearly judge customers' purchase intentions, and expand customers as quickly as possible. Through offline customers, the customer group is clear, and the order persistence rate and profit in the later period are high. Secondly, the event time includes Saturday and Sunday, so both retailers and wholesalers have the opportunity and time to visit the selection, which is very beneficial for us to expand our customers. Thirdly, according to the data of previous years, participating in the Expo can bring us real sales growth, high profit margin and good customer quality.

Someone believes that it is money, while some people think that it should be friendship. Actually, a strong marriage often needs more.\nMany romantic fictions tell people that love is the most important thing for a marriage. That is not wrong. A marriage without love is boring, even annoying. The couple will get tired of it at last. But love is not the basis of a strong marriage, because love is not steady. A marriage may be destroyed by infidelity. If love between two people is not unwavering enough, one of them may fall in love with other people long after they get married. (By the way, in China, we often see the seventh year as a turning point of a marriage. If the couple do not cheat in the first seven years of their marriage, people will think that the couple can live with each other for the rest of their life.) Because of that, a strong marriage needs something steadier :  duty. \nDuty does not mean a marriage without love or passion. On the contrary, it may be a result of strong love. Two people loving each other should be responsible for the relationship and the future of them. In the process of performance of their duties, they will feel happy and connect with each other more closely. \n\n\n\n"

How is this different from dialectic?\nWhat makes memes such an effective method of communication?\n\nHomework Assignment: What are some ways Donald Trump used memes to win enough votes to become president?\n\nIn 2016, history was made when Hillary Clinton lost the U.S. president election to a political neophyte, Donald J. Trump, who subsequently took office in the Oval Office. It was a resounding triumph for Donald Trump and his supporters. As millions of people congregated together to celebrate his victory, some might be wondering: How did this guy win the presidency?\n\nIf you think of Trump as merely an exaggerated maniac, you may be underestimating his intelligence. Trump has proven himself to be a shrewd strategist, using tactics such as memes to amplify his influence. Whether he's producing a catchy slogan or a memorable nickname for his opponents, these are all part of Trump's arsenal that he has used to great effect in his quest for the presidency.\n\nTrump's election slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" was a powerful and emotionally charged phrase that resonated with many. As he repeated this slogan in his speeches, the audience would join in, cementing the message deep into their subconscious. This messaging created the perception that a Trump presidency would restore America's power. Additionally, the slogan positioned Trump as a \"patriotic\" leader who would help millions of Americans \"take back\" the rights that they felt had been long taken away from them.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has a habit of giving people around him nicknames, often for specific purposes. For instance, he called Apple Inc's CEO, Tim Cook, \"Tim Apple\", and referred to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as \"Rocket man\". Perhaps the most significant nickname he gave was to his opponent in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden, whom he referred to as \"Sleepy Joe\". These nicknames, as part of the memes he created, had a significant impact on their owners. When people think of Biden, they will often associate him with \"Sleepy Joe\". As a result, it's challenging for people to ignore the impact these memes have had on their perceptions.\n\nAlong with his numerous memes, Trump's Twitter account played a significant role in his successful presidential campaign. He frequently posted his thoughts in a few sentences or even a few words, often including outrageous content to generate attention and remain in the public eye. For better or for worse, Trump thrived on people talking about him. Leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump dominated the television, turning almost all American News channels \"Trump TV.\" Trump proved adept at leveraging new forms of media. He followed in the footsteps of Roosevelt, who utilized radio to connect with the public, and Kennedy, who utilized television to win the presidency. Trump effectively harnessed the internet to spread memes and gain momentum, making his victory in the 2016 presidential election appear almost inevitable.\n\n    Even though Trump is no longer serving as the President of the United States, he continues to maintain a high public profile. He is utilizing his tried-and-true meme tactics to generate momentum for his potential 2024 presidential campaign. Whether people admire him or not, Trump is EVERYWHERE.\n\n"

I think some reasons may be the following: \nFirst, the team members do not have faith in the manager and there is a lack of trust between them. The team member might believe that the manager will not do anything useful for them, so being given the authority to delegate means additional tasks for them. Even though the manager explains that the delegating authority shows the company will value them, the team members still refuse to accept it. Therefore, the manager may find it challenging to assign tasks to team members. If the reason for delegation is unclear, the manager should reflect on the management style and consider how to establish a trustworthy relationship with others. \nSecond, the members of the team seem to prefer a more passive approach to their work, focusing solely on completing their assigned tasks without any additional effect. Consequently, they may resist any attempts to delegate additional responsibilities. If this is the case for all members, the manager may need to find ways to inspire and encourage them to embrace new challenges. \nThird, the team members are willing to take on the challenge, but they believe that their skills may not be sufficient to handle the additional workload. \nAs a manager, it is important to identify why delegation is not happening. If a manger understands their own needs and those of their team members, delegation becomes easier. In my opinion, I think the most significant issue is a lack of knowledge about the specific needs of team members..

There are some state-owned companies in China that tend to centralize, pursuing efficiency and precision. So, the managers of this kind of company are not encouraged to delegate authority. The result of this culture is constructing many levels of this organizational structure.\nIn conclusion, delegation of authority needs to be carefully analyzed by managers according to their specific situation.\n\n\n"

Moreover, a diverse workforce injects fresh blood into enterprises and brings vitality to them, which appeals to more talents. Finally, diversity also improves business relationships and drives total growth. Different employees can meet requirements of diverse customers, increasing customer satisfaction and sales revenues. \nNonetheless, a diverse workforce still brings challenges to companies. Firstly, the management efficiency will decrease. That means, it is harder for companies to manage diverse employees. Secondly, when companies encounter a problem, even though a diverse workforce can provide more ideas, it's also difficult to reach a consensus. It takes much time to make final decisions. At last, because diverse people have divergent habits, beliefs and other traits, it's easy to complicate the organizational interpersonal relationships. \n\n"

In China, public school is the dominant option for children and education is compulsory. However, education in the West in flexible as kids can go to another school besides public schools, even children can choose to study at home.\n\nIn the Western approach, education emphasizes individuality and critical thinking. Students are encouraged to think independently, express their opinions, and challenge existing ideas. The focus is on developing creativity, problem-solving skills, and analytical thinking. Western education also emphasizes practical knowledge and preparing students for the workforce. Students are often encouraged to pursue their own interests and talents through a variety of elective courses. By contrast, the Chinese curriculum system is more fixed and traditional, which more focus on English and Math, so it's hard for students to develop their talents and hobbies.\n\nIn addition, the school environment is more social in the West, while more academic in the East. In China, dating is not allowed before 18 years old. Some parents will have extreme ideas that the only thing students should do is study, and all the things unrelated to study should not be done.

In China, public school is the dominant option for children and education is compulsory. However, education in the West in flexible as kids can go to another school besides public schools. Children can even choose to study at home.\n\nIn the Western approach, education emphasizes individuality and critical thinking. Students are encouraged to think independently, express their opinions, and challenge existing ideas. The focus is on developing creativity, problem-solving skills, and analytical thinking. Western education also emphasizes practical knowledge and preparing students for the workforce. Students are often encouraged to pursue their own interests and talents through a variety of elective courses. By contrast, the Chinese curriculum system is more fixed and traditional, which focus more on English and Math, so it's hard for students to develop their talents and hobbies.\n\nIn addition, the school environment is more social in the West, while more academic in the East. In China, dating is not allowed before 18 years old. Some parents will have extreme ideas that the only thing students should do is study, and all the things unrelated to study should not be done. Western schools encourage students to participate in some social activities, dances, parties, clubs and church groups. What's more, dating is considered to be allowed and acceptable in high school.\n\nAfter school, Chinese students are often required to attend after-school classes so they can get better grades and get into a better university.

It is based on the idea of putting the body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates, which is achieved by greatly reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat intake.

The pros and cons cause controversy in society. \nSome proponents say that a UBI would supplement existing welfare programs. For those who do not have access to the traditional welfare programs, UBI provides them with more adequate financial security. What's more, UBI could reduce poverty and promote economic growth. For low-income individuals, UBI could be a godsend to rescue them from their difficult life. The promising result will be fewer people living in poverty. With the implementation of UBI, people's average income will also increase, which will promote economic growth. \nConversely, some people think a UBI will replace the traditional welfare programs and can't alleviate poverty. Although people's average incomes would rise, it could lead to inflation. They also are concerned that it would reduce people's working motivation and lead to a decrease in productivity and economic growth. If everyone can receive a fixed and respectable income, whether they work hard or not, some people may sit back and enjoy what they have and lose ambition. \nIn my opinion, the benefits of UBI outweigh the risks. With careful planning and implementation, UBI could be a positive step towards a well-off society. \n\n"

The Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States, is instrumental in this process. The Fed has several obligations to keep the financial, employment, and economic well-being in order, which include maximizing employment, stabilizing prices to prevent inflation and deflation, and moderating long-term interest rates. The Fed performs critical functions to promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system. It controls three tools to create new money by affecting the availability and cost of money.\nThe first is open market operations. The Fed creates new money to purchase financial assets, often government debt. This is also known as quantitative easing. Then interest rates fall and people will borrow and spend more, increasing the money supply and stimulating the economy. To summarize is that the Fed typically increases its holdings of long-term securities through open market purchases with the goal of putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates, thereby supporting economic activity and job creation by making financial conditions more accommodative.\nThe second is the discount rate, which is set for the short-term loans between banks. It is the basis of all other interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the easier it is to borrow. As a result, lower interest rates will also stimulate economic growth. The final tool is the reserve requirement. A bank should have no less than a certain percentage of its total liabilities to its customers in reserves. But now the percentage is 0% and the bank doesn't have to keep any deposits on hand. They can use that money for any other purpose. This is called fractional reserve banking. By reducing reserve requirements, the money supply will also increase.\n\n"

The Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States, is instrumental in this process. The Fed has several obligations to keep the financial, employment, and economic well-being in order, which include maximizing employment, stabilizing prices to prevent inflation and deflation, and moderating long-term interest rates. The Fed performs critical functions to promote the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the U.S. financial system. It controls three tools to create new money by affecting the availability and cost of money.\nThe first is open market operations. The Fed creates new money to purchase financial assets, often government debt. This is also known as quantitative easing. Then interest rates fall and people will borrow and spend more, increasing the money supply and stimulating the economy. In summary, the Fed typically increases its holdings of long-term securities through open market purchases with the goal of putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates, thereby supporting economic activity and job creation by making financial conditions more accommodative.\nThe second is the discount rate, which is set for the short-term loans between banks. It is the basis of all other interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the easier it is to borrow. As a result, lower interest rates will also stimulate economic growth.\nThe final tool is the reserve requirement. A bank should have no less than a certain percentage of its total liabilities to its customers in reserves. But now the percentage is 0% and the bank doesn't have to keep any deposits on hand. They can use that money for any other purpose. This is called fractional reserve banking. By reducing reserve requirements, the money supply will also increase.\n\n"

Well, it's bit of both. A little bit of inflation can be okay for economy because it encourages people to spend and invest their money. It can also help businesses grow and reduce the burden of debt. However, too much inflation is not good. It can make it harder for people to plan their finances and afford the things they need. High inflation can hurt those with fixed incomes or savings as their money loses value quickly.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Cantillon Effect. It explains how new money created by the government or central bank doesn't spread evenly in the economy. Instead, it benefits some people more than others. Those who are closer to the source of new money, like banks or big businesses, get the most advantage. They can access the new money first and benefit from it before prices rise. On the other hand, regular individuals may not see the same benefits and may feel the negative effects of inflation without gaining much.\n\nIn conclusion, while a little bit of inflation can be okay, too much inflation is not good. It can harm the economy and hurt people's ability to afford things. Additionally, the Cantillon Effect highlights how new money doesn't reach everyone equally, creating an uneven distribution of benefits. Therefore, it is important to manage inflation carefully and consider its long term impact on the economy.\n\n"

Insulin resistance is a condition in which the cells become less sensitive to the insulin. \nIf the people are genetically predisposed, the receptors on their cells themselves may poorly respond to insulin. Behaviorally speaking, excessive intake of carbohydrates and sugars will break down into too much glucose, and the pancreas will produce correspondingly more insulin. After prolonged excess consumption of carbohydrates, the receptors on the cells get used to the stimulation of excess insulin, and their response becomes weakened. As a result, blood sugar will remain high, leading to metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, the excess secretion of insulin can cause hyperperinsulinemia, which is also harmful to the body's metabolic process.\nTo address insulin resistance, in addition to medical intervention, maintaining a healthy lifestyle such as keeping a healthy diet and participating in physical activities can also be helpful.\n\n"

The campaign has been running since 1988 and is still used today. The campaign's slogan, \"Just Do It,\" is simple, catchy, and has become an iconic phrase that is synonymous with Nike's brand. The campaign features inspiring stories of athletes overcoming obstacles and achieving their goals, which resonates with consumers and helps them to connect emotionally with the brand. Additionally, Nike uses celebrities and high-profile athletes as brand ambassadors, which helps to increase the brand's visibility and credibility.\nIneffective Campaign: Pepsi's Kendall Jenner Ad\nPepsi's 2017 ad featuring Kendall Jenner is an example of an ineffective advertising campaign. The ad was criticized for trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement and using social justice issues to sell soda. The ad was seen as tone-deaf, and many people felt that Pepsi was exploiting serious social issues for profit. The ad received significant backlash on social media, and Pepsi eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology. The campaign failed to connect with consumers and damaged Pepsi's reputation.\nWhat makes Nike's \"Just Do It\" campaign better than Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad is the emotional connection it creates with consumers. Nike's campaign is inspiring, motivating, and encourages people to push themselves to be their best. The campaign's longevity and success are also a testament to its effectiveness. On the other hand, Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad failed to connect with consumers and was seen as insensitive and exploitative. The ad did not resonate with people, and the backlash it received damaged Pepsi's reputation. Ultimately, the key to an effective advertising campaign is to create an emotional connection with consumers and to be authentic in the message you are trying to convey.\n\n\n\n"

The campaign has been running since 1988 and remains relevant today. The campaign's slogan, \"Just Do It,\" is simple, catchy, and has become an iconic phrase that is synonymous with Nike's brand. It features inspiring stories of athletes overcoming obstacles and achieving their goals, striking an emotional chord with consumers and fostering a strong connection with the brand. Additionally, Nike uses celebrities and high-profile athletes as brand ambassadors, which helps to increase the brand's visibility and credibility.\nIneffective Campaign: Pepsi's Kendall Jenner Ad\nPepsi's 2017 ad featuring Kendall Jenner serves as an example of an ineffective advertising campaign. The ad drew critism for trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement and using social justice issues to promote soda. The ad was seen as tone-deaf, and many people felt that Pepsi was exploiting significant social issues for profit. The ad faced significant backlash on social media leading Pepsi to withdraw it and issue an apology. The campaign failed to resonate with consumers and reputational damage for Pepsi.\nWhat makes Nike's \"Just Do It\" campaign better than Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad is the emotional connection it established with consumers. Nike's campaign is inspiring, motivating, and encourages people to strive for their best. The campaign's longevity and success are also a testament to its effectiveness. On the other hand, Pepsi's Kendall Jenner ad failed to connect with consumers ,caoming across  as insensitive and exploitative. The ad lacked resonance with people, and the backlash it received damaged Pepsi's reputation. Ultimately, the key to an effective advertising campaign is to create an emotional connection with consumers and to be authentic in the message you are trying to convey.\n\n\n\n"

What's more, eastern students have to wear their uniforms. In China, students are not allowed to put on makeup.

But some students, teachers and parents have misinterpreted it. Teachers see marks as their \"KPI\". Parents think that high marks can bring their kids a bright future. What's more, students must follow the rules of their schools, or teachers may think them as \"bad kids\". Western approaches are really free, which may make students more independent and creative.

Both the benefits and drawbacks of globalization have had an important impact on the global society and economy.\n\nWe will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of globalization from the economic, cultural and environmental aspects.\n\nFirst, the benefits of globalization\n1. Promote economic development\nGlobalization has promoted trade and investment among countries, making the economies of countries more closely linked and the allocation of resources more efficient. At the same time, globalization has also promoted technological progress and innovation, improved production efficiency and reduced costs, which is conducive to promoting the development of the global economy.\n2. Promote cultural exchange and dissemination\nGlobalization has promoted the exchange and dissemination between cultures, making the exchange between different cultures more frequent and extensive. This kind of cultural exchange is not only conducive to promoting cultural diversity and innovation, but also helps to strengthen cultural harmony and understanding, thus promoting the development of global culture.\n3. Improve your education\nGlobalization has also helped to raise educational standards. In the context of globalization, educational resources, teaching methods and teaching methods can be better shared and exchanged between countries. Such exchanges not only help to raise educational standards, but also contribute to the development of a global knowledge economy.\n\nSecond, the disadvantages of globalization\n1. Widening the gap between the rich and the poor\nIn the process of globalization, the status of developing countries in the global economy is relatively low, and they are faced with various inequalities in economic, cultural and resource distribution. This has exacerbated the wealth gap between developing and developed countries, further widening inequality in the global economy.\n2. Environmental issues\nGlobalization has also brought harm to the environment to some extent. In the context of globalization, resources around the world have been exploited and utilized in large quantities, which has brought certain harm to the environment. Such environmental problems not only endanger the global ecological security, but also may further disturb the balance of global economic development.\n3. Culture clash\nGlobalization may also lead to conflicts between cultures. In the context of globalization, the exchange and integration of various cultures may lead to cultural assimilation and the imbalance of cultural power. This may lead to contradictions and conflicts between cultures, which is not conducive to the harmonious development of culture.\n\nIn conclusion, globalization has both advantages and disadvantages, which need to be better grasped and managed. Only on the basis of making full use of the advantages of globalization and overcoming its disadvantages can we promote the sustainable development of global economy, culture and environment, so as to realize the common interests of mankind.\n\nComments from Jane & MECI:\nOK.

How does it work?\n\n\nTo introduce the history of rules-based machine translation, we should first date back to the beginning of machine translation. In 1950s, America and the Soviet Union were competing for the dominance of the world. In order to win the competition, they needed to know their enemy as much as possible, so they needed to translate their enemy's information as soon as possible. Thanks to the invention of computing, in 1954, the Georgetown: IBM experiment started, and machine translation became true to help translate faster. \n\nAfter years of improving, the scientists came up with rules-based machine translation. To achieve it, they first needed translators to write down bilingual dictionaries and a set of linguistic rules for each language. They also needed lists of names, spelling correctors, and transliterators. Then programmers would turn these rules into program code so that the computer could use these rules to translate more efficiently. \n\nRules-based machine translation was a great progress, but it was challenging at the same time. On one hand, it took a long time for translators to write linguistic rules and for programmers to encode these rules. On the other hand, it was difficult to maintain the systems like when there was something wrong with the linguistic rules, the program code needed rewriting too.\n\n"

How does it work?\n\n\nTo introduce the history of rules-based machine translation, we should first date back to the beginning of machine translation. In the 1950s, America and the Soviet Union were competing for global dominance. In order to win the competition, they needed to know their enemy as much as possible, so they needed to translate their enemy's information as soon as possible. Thanks to the invention of computing, in 1954, the Georgetown: IBM experiment started, and machine translation became a reality to help translate faster. \n\nAfter years of research, the scientists came up with rules-based machine translation. To achieve it, they first needed translators to write down bilingual dictionaries and a set of linguistic rules for each language. They also needed lists of names, spelling correctors, and transliterators. Then, programmers would turn these rules into program code so that the computer could use these rules to translate more efficiently. \n\nRules-based machine translation was a great progress, but it was challenging at the same time. On one hand, it took a long time for translators to write linguistic rules and for programmers to encode these rules. On the other hand, it was difficult to maintain the systems. When there was something wrong with the linguistic rules, the program code needed rewriting too.\n\n"

In 1956, the Georgetown-IBM experiment created a system using Rules-based Machine Translation (RBMT). They needed a set of linguistic rules and a dictionary. But assembling an English rule set was easier than a Russian rule set, because Russian is morphologically complex. This means that programming the linguistic rules into the computer was time-consuming and laborious. It was full of challenges. As a result, the developers of the Rules-based MT had some limited success, such as the \"breakneck\" speed of two and a half lines per second. The researchers would also supplement the system with hacks, like lists of names, spelling correctors and transliterators. Although it wasn't ready for use in the real world, it was still a nice attempt in machine translation and laid a solid foundation for Statistic Machine Translation (SMT).\n\n"

In the first phase, SMT focused on word-level translation. It worked by splitting sentences into words and matching corresponding words in the two languages. Initially, word order was not considered. However, with the introduction of models 2, 3, 4, and 5, translation accuracy improved. \nIn the second phase, SMT came into the phrase-based stage. It works like the word-based SMT, except that it splits the text not only into words but also into phrases. This significantly enhanced translation accuracy. The popularity of phrase-based SMT led many major companies, such as Google and Microsoft, to adopt this method to enhance their translation systems. \nThe third phase, syntax-based SMT, allowed for precise syntax analysis of sentences and the construction of sentence trees.

After a large number of iterated attempts, human interventions, and correction training on the results, NMT can eventually learn how to make accurate translations.

These web pages showed different languages, and some even were translations of other pages. Therefore, they aligned the web pages and created bilingual corpora, which was the basis of statistical machine translation. Then they devoted themselves to training the computer with no specific rules but training it to learn rules in its own way. After that, it gave birth to statistical machine translation.\nAnd how does statistical machine translation work? Engineers gave statistical machine translation source text and reference translations with a huge number and the computer will match each segment millions and millions of times until it finds the word with the most appearance; it will decide the word is a probable translation.

Based on millions and millions of bilingual corpora, statistical machine translation engine divides them into n-grams and calculates the frequency of every n-gram. Therefore, statistical MT is just presenting the statistically most probable translation. It is also necessary for neural MT to use millions of segments of training data. However, the engine assigns a number (vector) to each word, which has a mathematical relationship with other words. Then the engine repeatedly attempts to predict the reference translation and learns from the feedback if it is wrong. After many iterations, it eventually gets the right answer and has learned rules and patterns between the languages. It's more like a human brain, predicting and learning from feedback.\nThe second key difference is fixing an incorrect translation. For statistical MT, the researchers can find the issue in the training data and fix it, or add more correct translation to crowd out the mistranslation. Nevertheless, a neural network is like a black box, and it is too complex to adjust the issue from inside for neural MT.

The Arab petroleum exporters of OPEC decided to raise the oil prices and embargo the US, leading to the oil crisis. \n\nDuring this time, the US urgently needed someone to buy its debt, or its dollars would have depreciated badly. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia earned billions of dollars from the oil embargo and needed to invest this big money. In the midst of Middle East War, Saudi Arabia also required weapons and protection to ensure security. \n\nSo, in 1974, the US sent Treasury Secretary William Simon to negotiate with Saudi Arabia. The US wanted Saudi Arabia to buy its debt, support its spending and sell oil for only US dollars. In exchange for this, it would provide Saudi Arabia military aid and enforce the global sale of oil for dollars.\n\nThat's the birth of the petrodollar, which had a big impact on the world. On one hand, Saudi Arabia became safer and more stable benefiting from the military and political support of the US. On the other hand, the US got the value of its dollars stabilized and expanded its military force worldwide.\n\n"

Gold can be divided into different units, which makes it convenient to trade and store. The ease of dispersion allows gold to adapt to a coincidence of wants.  \nThe second one is portability. Though gold is not as portable as currency, it still can be carried easily by hand, bag or case. Because gold can be split into small pieces as what we want, we can take gold anywhere we want by any way, such as plane, train, and cars. \nLast but not least, store of value is also a key characteristic of gold. On the one hand, the chemical properties of gold are naturally not easy to be changed by corroding or oxidizing, so it has stability. Stability allows gold to be preserved for a long time and not lost. On the other hand, gold is a kind of sound money with low supply. When new gold is mined, it barely adds anything to the massive existing supply. Thus, the price of gold is quite stable. In another words, the store of value of gold is protected by its high stock-to-flow ratio. The reason why gold with a high stock-to-flow ratio is scarce is that annual production relative to the existing stock is so small.\nThus, in my opinion, the three properties of gold make gold such an effective form of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Gold can be divided into different units, which makes it convenient to trade and store. The ease of dividing it into smaller units allows gold to be used as money.  \nThe second one is portability. Though gold is not as portable as currency, it still can be carried easily by hand, bag or case. Because gold can be split into small pieces as what we want, we can take gold anywhere we want by any way, such as plane, train, and cars. \nLast but not least, store of value is also a key characteristic of gold. On the one hand, the chemical properties of gold are naturally not easy to be changed by corroding or oxidizing, so it has stability. Stability allows gold to be preserved for a long time and not be lost. On the other hand, gold is a kind of sound money with a high stock but a low flow. When new gold is mined, it barely adds anything to the massive existing supply. Thus, the price of gold is quite stable. In another words, the store of value of gold is protected by its high stock-to-flow ratio. The reason why gold with a high stock-to-flow ratio is scarce is that annual production relative to the existing stock is so small.\nThus, in my opinion, the three properties of gold make gold such an effective form of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Salability is a property to standardize how effectively something can be used as money. During the barter period, people used cattle or something they had to have a direct exchange. But cattle couldn't be divided, so it was out pf date. Ancient China also used sea shells as money, but it wasn't portable enough and couldn't maintain its value. So divisibility, portability, and store of value make gold a good form of money.\n  Secondly, the rarity. Gold, a unique and scarce natural element, is a non-renewable resource. It is hard to mine the gold nor to produce it, so it's resistant to manipulation. As a result, gold supply has remained stable over the past few decades. Moreover, gold is not only rare, but also difficult to produce in large quantities relative to existing stocks. In other words, gold stock-to-flow ratio is 66 years, much higher than silver or platinum.\n  Thirdly, the gold standard. In the 1870s, almost all European countries accepted the value of gold and pegged the value of their currencies to the same amount of gold. Thus, gold became a sound money from that, and until now gold remains an important national stock in the world.\n\n"

They make perform translation quickly with acceptable quality and only require a bit post-editing. Now machine translation has become almost indispensable in the commercial translation workflow.\nThe T character in ChatGPT represents transformer, a language model that is initially used in neural MT. However, a transformer demonstrates a strong text-generation ability after acquiring sufficient training data, and it is then employed as an LLM. But a transformer's design is still responsible for its remarkable translation ability. Accordingly, LLMs like ChatGPT can be powerful and easily customized. Besides, with plenty of language data from various fields, LLMs can answer any question about translation strategy, cultural discrimination, writing style and so on, which means they can be a good consultant in translation. Furthermore, LLMs can also handle a series of localization tasks such as corpus processing, term extraction, and regular expression writing, making them excellent helpers.\n\n"

The improvement is mainly reflected in the pre-processing and review analysis of content, and also the assistance to translators throughout the whole translation process.\n\nIn terms of content-oriented work, ChatGPT can accomplish a wide range of tasks. On the one hand, it can swiftly summarize the background of a text, which simplifies the whole pre-editing process and enables translators to produce more accurate and contextually relevant translations. On the other hand, the function of extracting terms can also help translators reduce their workload while improving the coherence of their translation. \n\nAs the translator's right-hand assistant, ChatGPT can help them achieve more efficient and accurate translation throughout the entire translation process. Before translation, ChatGPT aids in the development of a suitable translation strategy. During translation, it assists translators in using language usage that aligns with the style of the source text. Subsequently, during the reviewing stage, it helps translators identify grammar and spelling errors, as well as exclude any inappropriate elements from the translated text.\n\n\n"

Share some examples.\n\nIt is a fake story about Maria, telling the phenomenon of the \"glass ceiling\", \"glass cliff\" and \"pink tax\" in real life.\nMaria is a 32-year-old African-American woman from a small underdeveloped town. She had been working at B company for eight years when she graduated from graduate school. Throughout her academic life, she achieved numerous awards and excellent grades, showcasing her dedication, competence, and education.\nHowever, life has been a constant struggle for Maria. In addition to facing the pink tax, where Maria pays more for the same products as men, she faces numerous challenges in both her professional and personal life, most of which are a result of her gender. When she first joined B company eight years ago, she started as a regular employee in the Marketing Department. After four years, she was promoted to a supervisor role within the same department. At that time, she was filled with joy and hoped to become a manager within the next four years, a promising prospect for a young woman. Unfortunately, despite her hard work, the reality did not align with her expectations, and she remains a supervisor to this day. This is due to a common and visible barrier in the workplace known as the \"glass ceiling\",  which prevents women from advancing to higher positions. This phenomenon is prevalent in many large companies, where women are often overlooked for managerial roles. Maria felt deeply sad and confused, but she knew that all she could do was continue working harder.\nTwo years later, during an economic depression at B company, Maria was unexpectedly chosen as the new manager.

Share some examples.\n\nIt is a fake story about Maria, telling the phenomenon of the \"glass ceiling\", \"glass cliff\" and \"pink tax\" in real life.\nMaria is a 32-year-old African-American woman from a small underdeveloped town. She had been working at Company B for eight years when she graduated from graduate school. Throughout her academic life, she achieved numerous awards and excellent grades, showcasing her dedication, competence, and education.\nHowever, life has been a constant struggle for Maria. In addition to facing the pink tax, where Maria pays more for the same products as men, she faces numerous challenges in both her professional and personal life, most of which are a result of her gender. When she first joined Company B eight years ago, she started as a regular employee in the Marketing Department. After four years, she was promoted to a supervisor role within the same department. At that time, she was filled with joy and hoped to become a manager within the next four years, a promising prospect for a young woman. Unfortunately, despite her hard work, the reality did not meet her expectations, and she remains a supervisor to this day. This is due to a common and visible barrier in the workplace known as the \"glass ceiling\",  which prevents women from advancing to higher positions. This phenomenon is prevalent in many large companies, where women are often overlooked for managerial roles. Maria felt deeply sad and confused, but she knew that all she could do was continue working harder.\nTwo years later, during an economic depression at Company B, Maria was unexpectedly chosen as the new manager. However, this promotion was merely a temporary measure to help the company overcome the crisis. Once the depression subsided, the executives would find reasons to replace her with another male candidate. This situation is known as the \"glass cliff\" in the workplace, where women are more likely to be appointed to leadership positions during times of crisis or downturn when the risk of failure is highest.\nIn the end, Maria discovered the truth and decided to leave Company B, dedicating herself to fighting for gender equality.\n\n"

Europe and north America have long-lasting culture stereotypes history for women, while countries like Iran don't. Maybe culture tipped the scale. \nIn my opinion, I think the first explanation is a reasonable one according to the statistics of this paradox. \n\n\n"

In this case, several concepts emerge from the situation, like the glass ceiling, the pink tax, the glass cliff, etc. It is important to understand what they mean and how they impact individuals in the workforce.\n\nThe glass ceiling is an invisible barrier that prevents women from advancing to higher positions in the workplace. Despite being equally qualified as their male counterparts, it is harder for women to get executive and board positions in many companies. Some companies provide fewer opportunities for women in order to avoid paying for maternity leave, which comes out of the company's pocket.\n\nThe pink tax refers to the higher prices for products and services designed for women. This can include everything from clothing and personal care products to healthcare and financial services. The result is that women often end up paying more for the same products and services as men, simply because of their gender.\n\nThe glass cliff represents the phenomenon where women are more likely to be put in leadership positions during times of crisis or when a company is facing difficult challenges. While this may seem like an opportunity for advancement, it can also be seen as a form of discrimination, as these individuals are often set up for failure. This can lead to a lack of opportunities for women in leadership positions.\n\nIn conclusion, the glass ceiling, pink tax, and glass cliff are all barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce.

Several conepts to understand are the glass ceiling, the pink tax, the glass cliff, etc. It is important to understand what they mean and how they impact individuals in the workforce.\n\nThe glass ceiling is an invisible barrier that prevents women from advancing to higher positions in the workplace. Despite being equally qualified as their male counterparts, it is harder for women to get executive and board positions in many companies. Some companies provide fewer opportunities for women in order to avoid paying for maternity leave, which comes out of the company's pocket.\n\nThe pink tax refers to the higher prices for products and services designed for women. This can include everything from clothing and personal care products to healthcare and financial services. The result is that women often end up paying more for the same products and services as men, simply because of their gender.\n\nThe glass cliff represents the phenomenon where women are more likely to be put in leadership positions during times of crisis or when a company is facing difficult challenges. While this may seem like an opportunity for advancement, it can also be seen as a form of discrimination, as these individuals are often set up for failure. This can lead to a lack of opportunities for women in leadership positions.\n\nIn conclusion, the glass ceiling, pink tax, and glass cliff are all barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the workforce. By understanding these terms and their impact, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive workplace for all.\n\n"

Biological factors may influence women's preference of some such as education, personal care, and administrative support. Proponents of this view generally hold that men and women are different in important ways.\nSecondly, let's focus on the culture. In the West, cultural stereotypes limit women to certain professions.

Humans can choose the right meaning through our experience, but the machine cannot. And for culture-specific language, like some words in Chinese medicine, the machine has no Chinese cultural background.

What can we learn from this game?\n\nCopycat is an effective strategy because it can minimize its losses and maximize its gains in repeated interactions with different types of players. Compared with detective, which spent too much time on observation, all cheat, which has no possibility of cooperation, and grudger, who is too intolerant, copycat can achieve a win-win with cooperative players and avoid being exploited by cheating players, minimizing the risks he may encounter.  \n\nCopykitten improves on copycat's strategy by being more forgiving and resilient to miscommunication. He also starts by cooperating and then copies the opponent's last move, but ignores the first defection by the opponent. This means that he can restore trust with a cooperative player who accidentally cheated once, or with another copycat who misinterpreted a move. copykitten's average score is higher than copycat's, especially when the level of miscommunication is low.

As a result, most people will decide to meet each other at the Eiffel Tower at 12 p.m. Because the Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark of Paris and 12 p.m. is a free time for most people.\nThe Schelling point has pervaded every aspect of our lives. For instance, when we lose in Disney World, we will probably choose to meet friends at Cinderella Castle. In business, the use of Schelling points is to create a unique selling point (USP). For example, some lipstick brands claim that they produce non-stick lipstick, so more consumers choose to buy their lipstick.\nAll in all, Schelling points are influencing our lives.\n\n"

It is a salient option chosen by multiple people without communication.\nFor example, let's imagine you and your partner are asked to choose a cell from a 6 by 6 grid without communication. If you choose the same one, you will get a prize. The color of each cell varies: green, purple, and blue. However, the color of one cell stands out: red. The concept of Schelling points teaches us that you and your partner are likely to both choose the most salient option, which is the red cell.\nAnother example is this. You are asked to meet a stranger in Paris, Without communicating with your partner, what location and time would you choose? The concept of Schelling points teaches us that most people will decide to meet each other at the Eiffel Tower at 12 p.m. That's because the Eiffel Tower is likely the most famous landmark of Paris and 12 p.m. is a free time for most people. 12 p.m. also has salience as the sun is directly overhead. 12 p.m. is called \"noon\" or \"midday.\" For this reason, 12 p.m. stands out among other possible times of day.\nSchelling points pervade every aspect of our lives. For instance, if you become separated from your friends at Disneyland, there's a good chance you can meet up with your friends at Disneyland's Schelling point: Cinderella Castle. In business, the use of Schelling points is to create a unique selling point (USP). For example, some lipstick brands claim that they produce non-stick lipstick, so more consumers choose to buy their lipstick.\nAll in all, Schelling points are influencing our lives.\n\n"

Take Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions as an example.

Among these political parties, the republican and democratic party are the two most powerful that manage the country in turns. This kind of system  underlines individual work which attaches great importance to personal achievements.\nOn the other hand, the education plays an important role in this difference.

This is the interdependence level in which you realize the importance of mutual trust. During this time, you will face many challenges, such as how to cope with relationships with colleagues to achieve win-win results. Trust is an integral ingredient for successful teamwork and effective team collaboration. Thus, one becomes interdependent with others and looks for synergies to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n\n"

Adults rely on each other to achieve the same goal, raising children or make the whole family live a better life.

One is the reason why easterners and westerners value success and achievement. Richard believes that Easterners attach more importance to the impact of success on their community, while westerners pay more attention to what success means to themselves as individuals. However, I do not agree with this view. I think both ideas exist in the East and the West, and the view of success depends on the situation. If you are trying to win a competition on your own, then this success is more a recognition of your own ability, but if your company are trying to win a bid, then the success is more a reflection of the performance of the entire group. Another difference is about debate. Richard considers that easterners avoid controversy and debate, while westerners have faith in the rhetoric of argumentation in arenas from the law to politics to science. But from my own experience of living in China for 20 years, Chinese love to debate, but in most cases where their own interests are not involved, they will choose not to express their opinions in order to save their time or maintain a state of peace. Nevertheless, if they have enough time or just happen to be in the mood for debate, they can argue for three days and three nights about even small things. The cultural differences between the East and the West do exist, but as the exchanges between the two sides go deeper and deeper, we will find that there is an intercommunity in various cultures.

I would like to explain how China and the United States perform differently on Individualism and Indulgence dimensions.\nFirstly, the Individualism dimension is about the relative importance of individual versus group interests. China is less individual than the United States. China has an individualism score of 20, which means China is a collectivist country.

I would like to explain how China and the United States perform differently on the dimensions of Individualism and Indulgence.\nFirstly, the Individualism dimension is about the relative importance of individual versus group interests. China is less individualistic than the United States. China has an individualism score of 20, which means China is a collectivist country.

Discuss factor analysis, spectrum vs. binary, neutral (value-free) vs. non-neutral (value-laden)\nIn my opinion, the main differences between the MBTI and the Big 5 are two aspects: each personality trait is a spectrum or a binary; MBTI is value-free and the Big 5 is value-laden.\nFirst of all, the Big 5 model was created by factor analysis (a statistical method), which made the model more scientific. And the Big 5 shows that each personality trait is a spectrum. That is to say, it describes the 5 personality traits with high levels and low levels: high openness vs low openness, high conscientiousness vs low conscientiousness, high extroversion vs low extroversion and so on. However, the MBTI describes personality as black-and-white. For instance, when you do an MBTI test, you will find you are an extravert or introvert. In this aspect, I think the Big 5 is more scientifically valid than MBTI.\nFurthermore, MBTI is value-free and the Big 5 is value-laden. There are 4 aspects in MBTI and each aspect has two faces, but every face is described as good. For example, a thinker mostly uses their head while a feeler mostly uses their heart. We cannot say which one is better. However, the Big 5 is value-laden. Because the Big 5 model shows high levels and low levels, there are better ones. Such as high neuroticism means who often feels anxious and irritable, but low neuroticism means who is more likely to be calm and emotionally stable. As far as I am concerned, MBTI is more rational than the Big 5.\nIn short, MBTI is value-free and describes each personality trait as a binary, while the Big 5 is value-laden and describes each personality trait as a spectrum.\n\n"

How do these concepts help build trust?\nThe Evolution of Trust game has shown us three key takeaways: repeat interactions, possible win-wins and low miscommunication.\nRepeat interactions mean people need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve. We must know if others will do the same things for us in the future, so we can choose to trust or not. Both of us know possible future repeat interactions, and we will trust each other. That helps build trust and trust keeps the relationship going.\nThe second one is possible win-wins, which means you must be playing a non-zero-sum game. That is to say, both players can benefit. We can imagine that if you can be better off from a game, you may think your partner is great and choose to trust him or her. And it can interplay you two. Then you two build trust.\nThe last one is low miscommunication. In our daily lives, we miscommunicate with others more or less. If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. For instance, your friend does not get your joke, which offends him or her because of a different cultural background. But your friend does not want to communicate with you and you just do not understand that. Then you two may cause a high miscommunication and you may distrust each other anymore. However, a low miscommunication pays to be more forgiving and can help build trust.\nAll in all, take advantage of the three key takeaways to help build trust.\n\n"

Minimizing miscommunication is in everyone's best interest. When there's a bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving.

How can we mitigate the drawbacks?\nA: \tGlobalization is a double-edged sword which has several pros and cons.\nIt stimulates countries' economic growth as countries produce and export products which they have a comparative advantage in. Also, countries import goods from each other, so people can buy various goods from all over the world without traveling far and choose products which meet their quality standard. As a result, countries earn more money from superior products and people raise their life quality.\nHowever, globalization also causes problems. Countries are encouraged to transfer technology across the border which promotes industrialization.

How can we mitigate the drawbacks?\nA: \tGlobalization is a double-edged sword which has several pros and cons.\nIt stimulates countries' economic growth as countries produce and export products in which they have a comparative advantage. Also, countries import goods from each other, so people can buy various goods from all over the world without traveling far and choose products which meet their quality standard. As a result, countries earn more money from superior products and people enjoy higher quality of life.\nHowever, globalization also causes problems. Countries are encouraged to transfer technology across the border which promotes industrialization. But the fast pace of development causes more pollution which might produce more serious environmental problems if no corresponding solutions rise to meet the challenge. In addition, globalization makes countries become vulnerable since they depend more on other countries' products and services. For example, after the eruption of war between Russia and Ukraine disrupted German's natural gas supply chain from Russia. As a result, Germans had to purchase energy at a high price.\nThe drawbacks cannot be eliminated completely. Countries are supposed to cooperate with each other closely so that every country can develop well. And the only way to maintain globalization is to promote peace.\n\n"

RBMT can be categorized into 3 types, the direct machine translation, transfer-based RBMT and interlingua machine translation. \nThe direct machine translation separates the text into words and corrects the morphology and syntax and linguists need to write the rules of each word for it. But the most results of translation are unsatisfying. Then the scientists focused more on general grammar rules instead of every single word and created the transfer-based machine translation. However, this method results in more human resources needed for writing word constructions rules which are more than single words rules. The third type of RBMT is interlingual machine translation where the source text is transformed to the intermediate language. Since this ideal method is not specific to one language pair, languages can transform into each other in spite of the different syntactical constructions. But the universal interlingua is extremely hard to create.\nThe RBMT was dead in the river of history because languages are not framed in some specific rules.

Secondly, if the deal is in harmony with the interests and values of my fans, and does not conflict with my own, I am open to considering it. \nIn addition, I will also consider the reasons behind this brand deal proposed by a company that I don't like. Perhaps they realize their shortcomings and hope to improve their image by collaborating with influencers. In this situation, I can try to communicate with them, express my concerns and expectations, and see if they are willing to make changes. If there is a genuine commitment from the company to change and align with my values, I also would be open to reevaluating the deal.\nIn conclusion, when faced with a lucrative brand deal proposed by a company I don't like, my approach is one of careful contemplation. I must balance my personal values, the expectations of my followers, and the potential for positive change in the company's practices. Only in this way can I make wise decisions that align with my identity as an influencer.\n\n\n"

Firstly, his desire for pursuing the sun is not a calling for the adventure, but his own ambition. Secondly, Kuafu hasn't finished his journey, and he dies of thirst before he could reach his goal, while traditional The Hero's Journey usually involves a series of trials, allies, enemies, and ultimately victory and return.

Nevertheless, when it comes to ancient works, the shadow of The Hero's Journey fades away, because it is mature template developed on the basis of myriad of stories. As a result, ancient stories could jump out of this circle and show wild imagination.\nFor example, there's an ancient Chinese myth called Kuafu Pursues the Sun. Kuafu, a giant, pursued the sun with great strides. His thirst grew unbearable, and he sought to quench it from the Yellow River and the Wei River, but the waters were not enough. He then headed north to drink from the Great Marsh, but before he could reach it, his thirst overcame him, and he perished. In the place where he dropped his walking staff, a dense forest sprang up, known as Denglin.\nKuafu Pursues the Sun apparently doesn't line up with The Hero's Journey. Firstly, his desire for pursuing the sun is not a call to adventure, but his own ambition. Secondly, Kuafu hasn't finished his journey, and he dies of thirst before he could reach his goal. On the other hand, a traditional Hero's Journey usually involves a series of trials, allies, enemies, and ultimately victory and return. The story of Kuafu emphasizes sacrifice and failure more, reflecting on the exploration of the limits of heroes and the reverence for the power of nature.\n\n"

Let's dive into characters of Journey to the West based on the pattern of archetypes.\nFirstly, the hero must be the main character Sun Wukong, who possesses the superior capabilities and intelligence, navigating the team overcoming series of trials during their journey to the west. As the outlaw in the story, Sun Wukong represents the rebellious teenager in Chinese society as he rarely obeys the rules and frequently disregards the authority of elders, just like kids challenging against their parents. Sun Wukong's changes by the story's end symbolize the social conditioning and the personal growth.\nBoth Tang Monk and Guanyin play the mentor role in the story, giving Sun Wukong advice and assistance to promote his growth. As Sun Wukong's master, Tang Monk serves as a traditional mentor figure. He has the responsibility to correct him, teaching him valuable lessons and moralizing him with his kindness, sincerity and patience. While Guanyin, who only shows up when at critical moments, is more like people emerging from the shadow. She gives Sun Wukong enlightenment and protects him when he is in danger.\nThe pattern of archetypes shows that heroes are similar in nature, nevertheless the unique personalities they have.\n\n\n\n\n"

Give some examples why this is or isn't the case.\n\nThere are many similarities between Chinese hero's stories and the Hero's Journey described by Joseph Campbell, including the character portrayal. Let's dive into characters of Journey to the West based on the pattern of archetypes.\nFirstly, the hero must be the main character Sun Wukong, who possesses the superior capabilities and intelligence, navigating the team and overcoming a series of trials during their journey to the west. As the outlaw in the story, Sun Wukong represents the rebellious teenager in Chinese society as he rarely obeys the rules and frequently disregards the authority of elders, just like kids challenging their parents. Sun Wukong's changes by the story's end symbolize social conditioning and personal growth.\nBoth Tang Monk and Guanyin play the mentor role in the story, giving Sun Wukong advice and assistance to promote his growth. As Sun Wukong's master, Tang Monk serves as a traditional mentor figure. He has the responsibility to correct him, teaching him valuable lessons and fostering moral growth with his kindness, sincerity and patience. While Guanyin, who only shows up when at critical moments, is more like people emerging from the shadow. She gives Sun Wukong enlightenment and protects him when he is in danger.\nThe pattern of archetypes shows that heroes are similar in nature, despite the unique personalities they have.\n\n\n\n\n"

However, specifically, the hero's ending and growth process may be slightly different in movies produced by different countries.\n\nAfter analyzing countless myths, legends, and folktales, Joseph Campbell, an American professor came up with the idea of \"hero's journey\", which shows the common thread in different hero stories and movies. Basically, \"hero's journey\" believes that at the beginning of a story, the hero is focusing on its own life and feels indifferent to other tasks, but a saint or a guide will appear to convince the hero. After that, the hero's journey will be smooth at first, but it will be beaten by a powerful enemy or encounter a huge challenge in the middle of the story. In the end, the hero always overcomes the difficulty and upgrades into the strongest version, then a happy ending is completed. I have watched a lot of American action movies, and I think they basically go the same with \"hero's journey\". But in Chinese stories, the hero's ending can be a little different.\n\nIn many Chinese movies, a hero usually has two kinds of endings. One accords with the \"hero's journey\", but the other is the hero sacrifices itself to achieve a peaceful life for the public. I suppose the two different endings show cultural differences. The US is more about individualistic heroism, but Chinese culture is more about collectivism.

We all know that influencers need followers, so maybe they make sincere recommendations at first, but when they have enough followers, they need more money and care about followers less. However, I do not think we followers have the right to condemn influencers, they do a job and make ends meet. Therefore, I choose not to trust their recommendations.\n\n"

Usually, there is no argument and even no more interaction between the speaker and the audience.

The speaker tries to convince the listener through calm and logical discourse. They need to do a lot of thinking to support their own arguments and deal with the interrupt caused by the opposite's rebuttals. It is a reciprocal process that both sides finally achieve a universal truth through close communication and debate. In conclusion, dialectic is rational and argumentative, while rhetoric is emotional and non-argumentative.\n\nA meme or online post contains its poster's argument that is often exaggerate and emotive.

In fact, most of such movies aim to portray the loyalty and unity of soldiers. This film doesn't deviate from that formula either. To thwart enemies' conspiracy, the protagonist (Leng Feng) and his teammates close rank and engage in fierce combat with the mercenaries.

He takes good advantages of memes, and makes an astonishing shift into a politician by utilizing marketing strategies as a sophisticated businessman. Here are two methods that he uses. \n\nThe first one is creating personal memes such as \"Make America Great Again\", \"Build the Wall\", and viral tweets with simple but sharp words. In his previous role as a TV star, he was dedicated to making everybody know him. The public doesn't pay as much attention to detailed policy as professional politicians, but they are interested in memes. In a street interview, even a little child can imitate Trump's gesture and say \"Make America Great Again\". It is no longer a political initiative, but a powerful viral meme that turned Trump into well-known political leader. \n\nThe second method is creating poisonous but funny memes for his opponents. Trump gave each of his opponents offensive nicknames. They are offensive but impressive. He zooms in on the weakness of his opponents, not only distracting and infuriating his opponent, but also creating a humorous and comical atmosphere. This ridiculous gesture changes a serious political debate into a childish game, but it suits his image and it works. It is hard for anyone else to imitate this strategy successfully, but Trump managed to get away with it.  \n\n"

What does it mean to spread vertically or horizontally?\n\nGenes and memes are both easily spread, although they have different functions and modes of transmission.\n\nGenes are passed down from parents to offspring to transfer traits from one generation to the next. They are encoded in the DNA and play a crucial role in determining an organism's physical and biological characteristics. Therefore, gene's way of transmission is usually vertical and the rang of transmission is more specific. Horizontal transmission of genes can be represented by the transfer of different species, but it is rare to see.\n\nOn the other hand, memes embody cultural identities, common values or styles that spread from person to person within a society, showing popular trends among a generation. Unlike genes, memes are transmitted through social learning, and communication, so, they are more likely to be transmitted by individuals of the same generation. Therefore, the transmission mode of memes is more horizontal, because their spreading range is quite unlimited. Although cultural traits can be spread from older generations to younger ones, memes are representatives of certain fashion trends that keep evolving. The generation gap is an obstacle to successful inter-generational transmission of ideas. \n\n"

What about an online discussion board?\n\nRhetoric and dialectic are different methods we can use during argumentation and communication. Rhetoric content like motivational speech, usually focuses on persuasive language and is often used to influence other's opinions. So, rhetoric emphasizes emotional appeal. Dialectic, on the other hand, emphasizes logical reasoning and the exchange of ideas through calm conversations to find truth or a better understanding of a topic.\n\nAs for memes, a way to influence public ideas or behavior, I suppose they are more rhetoric because a good meme should be widely spread on the internet. Rhetoric strategies like humor or satire, are more in line with the nature of the online environment, where individuals more focus on persuasive and emotional appeal through visual and textual elements. If you are familiar with Donald Trump, you will know that he became famous largely because many of his memes went viral online. His controversial memes are short and extreme enough to get everybody talking, whether it is criticism or praise. Therefore, I believe memes are a rhetoric method more often used on social media.\n\nHowever, if we are discussing a professional online discussion board, it is more likely to be seen as a dialectic platform, as it provides a place for the exchange of ideas, logical arguments, and debate among participants who want to gain a deeper understanding of various topics.\n\n"

For them, the attainment of self-worth means happiness.\nOn the other hand, marriage and parenthood can present a set of challenges that potentially reduce one's sense of well-being. Although a harmonious marital relationship brings us warmth and strength, maintaining it requires consistent effort, compromise and effective communication. Sometimes, a terrible marriage relationship can also lead to constant misery. Additionally, rearing and educating children well is not a simple task either, as it requires parents to invest more time and energy in taking care of them more carefully. This responsibility often encroaches on individuals' work time and personal time, which leads to many complex challenges that not everyone is ready or willing to take on.\n\n\n"

                "content": "Q: Will automation eventually put humans out of a job? In that case, does it make sense to implement UBI?\nA:\n As automation advances, the concern about whether automation will eventually put humans out of a job grows. In my opinion, automation inevitably destroys some jobs, but at the same time it also creates many jobs.\n However, the vital part is that the speed of destroying jobs is much higher than the speed of creating jobs. For instance, many manufacturing industries are introducing automated robots for high-speed, high-quality, and low-cost production. This shift has led to a reduction in the need for human workers. So even though automation has created many high-tech industries, there are many people facing job crisis or technological unemployment.\n In light of this trend, the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) gains traction. UBI proposes to provide all citizens with the same amount of money, no strings attached. In that case, the implementation of UBI seems essential and effective, ensuring that individuals can meet their basic needs and pursue higher-level activities.

In that case, does it make sense to implement UBI?\nA:\n As automation advances, the concern about whether automation will eventually put humans out of a job grows. In my opinion, automation inevitably destroys some jobs, but at the same time it also creates many jobs.\n However, the vital part is that the speed of destroying jobs is much higher than the speed of creating jobs. For instance, many manufacturing industries are introducing automated robots for high-speed, high-quality, and low-cost production. This shift has led to a reduction in the need for human workers. So even though automation has created many high-tech industries, there are many people facing a job crisis due to technological unemployment.\n In light of this trend, the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been gaining traction. UBI proposes to provide all citizens with the same amount of money, no strings attached. Described this way, the implementation of UBI seems essential and effective, ensuring that individuals can meet their basic needs and pursue higher-level activities. They can create greater social value and better survive in the automated world. But some opponents of UBI have raised potential negative behavioral effects for example, suppressing labor supply or spending money on harmful goods. That makes sense, but overall, UBI is a catalyst for the future and should be seriously considered in the pursuit of a more equal and stable society.\n\n"

By doing so, interest rates declines and this encourages banks to lend more money to businesses and individuals, stimulating economic activity. Or during times of economic downturn, the Fed may expand its asset purchases beyond government bonds to include other financial assets, such as corporate bonds, to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing and investment.

How can you go about learning these things?\n\nIn this response, I will focus on two aspects that cannot be fully taught in a traditional educational setting: the practical application of knowledge and personal goal management. \n\nFirstly, it is widely acknowledged that we students are introduced to foundational knowledge and problem-solving methods in school, and some of us even have engaged in hands-on projects. However, these experiences are typically guided by academic goals or pre-set course targets. We are not immersed in the actual industry, making it difficult to gauge whether our application of knowledge aligns with industry standards or genuinely enhances efficiency in a certain work flow. For instance, based on my internship experience at Baidu, I realize that the knowledge I acquired in school is important, but it merely provides a relatively standardized framework or theoretical basis for my work. In actual practice, to achieve true efficiency and high productivity, I must learn to \"compromise\" and consider a broader range of factors. These include the work flows preferred by the company, the familiar communication styles among colleagues, and the company's proprietary platforms and tools. These are several aspects that I could not learn from my academic courses.\n\nSecondly, once we leave the school system, we must independently plan our lives, instead of following the school's regulations or teachers' advice. Since the life purposes span much longer timelines and may take years to manifest, our ability to break down long-term targets into manageable short-term ones is essential.

Let's compare education systems in China to the U.S. for instance.\nFirst of place, schooling in China is compulsory. Before junior high school, students are freely absorbed and schools have no power to drop out students randomly. On the contrary, schooling in the U.S. is optional. Children can choose to attend classes in the school or receive homeschooling from their parents, tutors or online resources, or even pursuit unschooling. There is no law forcing children to be educated.\nAdditionally, Chinese schools usually group students of the same age and academic level together since almost all children attend school. This make it easier to manage students and teach according to groups' academic levels. While classes in American schools are normally mix of different ages, races and academic levels. Students are not required to be unified or similar but unique, with more opportunities to interact with people of diverse experiences and characteristics.\nUltimately, the emphasis on shaping and providing environment differs.

                "content": "How do Western and Eastern approaches to education differ?\n\nApproaches to education between Eastern and Western have several distinctions, representing the diverse cultural backgrounds and beliefs. Let's compare education systems in China to the U.S. for instance.\nFirst of all, schooling in China is compulsory. Before junior high school, students are completely absorbed into the education system and students have no power to drop out of school at will. On the contrary, schooling in the U.S. is optional. Children can choose to attend classes at school or receive homeschooling from their parents, tutors or online resources, or even pursuit unschooling. There is no law forcing children to be educated.\nAdditionally, Chinese schools usually group students of the same age and academic level together since almost all children attend school. This make it easier to manage students and teach according to the academic level of each group. In contrast, classes in American schools are normally a mix of different ages, races and academic levels. Students are not required to be unified or similar, but instead are encouraged to be unique, with more opportunities to interact with people of diverse experiences and characteristics.\nUltimately, the emphasis on shaping the education environment differs. China focuses on fostering an academic environment, highlighting the importance of knowledge and curriculum itself. Therefore, the most crucial mission for students is to study hard to pass the gaokao and get into a great college, often leaving little time for other activities. In contrast, America prioritizes a social environment, where students improve themselves through practice and extracurricular activities apart from knowledge in the books. \n\n\n"

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposal in which the government distributes basic money to every person in the country, mostly without strings attached. During the age of Coronavirus, the U.S. Government implemented UBI. In 2021, South Korea also implemented UBI, called Gyeonggi Pay.\nSo, what are the benefits of UBI? First is poverty reduction, UBI can provide a \"shelter\", ensuring a minimum standard of living for everyone. In that case, more people may stay above the poverty line. In addition, UBI can boost economic development. When people have more disposable income, they can spend more. Besides, I think UBI benefit people's mental health. Most graduates cannot find a job to make a living, but UBI can give them a break.\nNow, let's zoom in on the risks of UBI. The serious one is work disincentive. A stable freedom dividend may \"incentivize\" the receivers not to work. In that case, the society may be stagnant and even regressive. The other one is receivers may spend the money on terrible areas, for instance, the youngster may spend the money buying drugs or gambling.\nBut in my view, the risks of UBI can be settled by adding some strings attached, for instance, the receivers can only use UBI on some specific aspects. Therefore, let's compare the benefits and risks, I think the risks cannot destroy the benefits, in that case, the benefits of UBI outweigh the risks.\n\n"

In addition, UBI can boost economic development. When people have more disposable income, they can spend more. Additionally, I think UBI can benefit people's mental health. Most graduates cannot find a job to make a living, but UBI can give them a break.\nNow, let's zoom in on the risks of UBI. The most serious one is how it disincentivizes work. A stable \"freedom dividend\" may \"incentivize\" the receivers not to work. In that case, the society may be stagnant and even regressive. The other risk is that receivers may spend the money unwisely. For instance, youngsters may spend the money on drugs or gambling.\nBut in my view, the risks of UBI can be settled by adding some strings attached, for instance, the receivers can only use UBI on some specific purchases. Therefore, let's compare the benefits and risks. I think the risks don't outweigh the benefits. In that case, UBI is a wise policy to implement.\n\n"

The movie underscores a strong sense of patriotism, self-sacrifice and collectivism. The heroes' collaboration and bravery in protecting their beloved country and people show their unwavering dedication to the country.\nAmerican heroes strongly embody individualism. There is little teamwork, and when there is, there is a lot of conflict. In contrast, Chinese heroes will sacrifice themselves for common interests of the community. But American heroes focus more on their own interests. They are unwilling to act altruistically. They may save their friends by sacrificing others.\n\n"

Here are some examples that perfectly reflect their characteristics.\nIn Wolf Warrior, the protagonist undertakes heavier tasks to rescue all Chinese citizens and protect national peace. In My People, My Country, it uses seven short films to show their common vision aiming for a better motherland. In this movie, you can't even name a specific hero because the community of heroes includes all mankind. In The Battle at Lake Changjin, the Chinese People's Volunteers sacrificed themselves with brave and fearless fighting spirit for the country's peace. All these movies convey the value of patriotism.\nIn addition, in Wandering Earth, China adheres to a community with a shared future and decides to leave the solar system with the Earth, which shows the attachment to their homeland.

This two convey the value of collectivism.\nHowever, in La La Land, they didn't end up together in pursuit of their own dreams.

What are their aims?\n\nChinese heroes often attach great importance to collectivism, whose core is social harmonious and relationships. For example, in the movie Wolf Warrior, the protagonist fight for the peace, together with common people from other countries. Aiming to achieve social harmonious, this movie underscores a strong sense of patriotism, which rooted in Chinese culture.\nIn contrast, American heroes usually shows individualism, with a strong focus on self-realization and freedom. They may fight for personal beliefs or ideals, instead of the whole country or earth. For example, in the movie La La Land, although the hero and the heroine love each other, they both have own dreams. Therefore, it does not end in what we often see in traditional love movies. However, they went to pursue dreams and split up at the end of this movie. This is a typical example showing individualism.\nAs mentioned above, Chinese heroes' aims may be closely linked to the well-being of the family, social or nation, shaping their characteristics such as the loyalty for their own countries and the spirit of perseverance.

As a Chinese myself, contrasting the culture between China and the Western world, individualism or collectivism holds a great impact on the society till today. This leads to every single one's characteristics and thoughts. \n\nLet's zoom into one specific aspect of its products, which is how people talk. I agree with Richard Nisbett on this perspective. Chinese people tend to express the same thing in a less direct way than the westerners do. It usually needs a high emotional quotient if you want to totally understand a sophisticated man's words. It indeed gives a modest impression and builds a harmonious atmosphere, but it also causes a little hard work to \"guess\" what people really want to convey.\n\nWhile in the western society, no matter you are a leader or an employee, you can free to talk and boldly express in direct words. Partly because of the individualism, people care more about themselves, and focus on if their thoughts are clearly conveyed or if their demands are validly requested. \n\n"

I quite agree with this idea. \nWesterners communicate their ideas clearly so that they are more or less understood independently of the context. Chinese communicate ideas more indirectly that can only be understood within proper context. For example, when someone did something you really don't approve of and it caused bad results, Westerners are apt to point out their mistakes directly. They all expect each other to speak openly and truthfully, even if it hurts others' feelings. Instead, Chinese tend to deal with it in totally different and indirect ways. One way is that they will point out their mistakes politely to avoid hurting one's feelings and relationships with each other. The other way is that they may use words that say the opposite of what they really mean. They will probably say \"You did a really good job\".

What can be done to prepare for the disaster or prevent it? \n\nAmong all the natural phenomena, the earthquake is the most common one to occur unpredictably here and there. When its magnitude under 4, people are hardly aware of it. However, the earthquake can be destructive beyond our imagination. When its magnitude is high, the ground is trembling and every item is shaking. In 2008, a magnitude 8 earthquake struck in Wenchuan, a county in Sichuan. City buildings turned into the ruins in a short period of time. Millions of people lost their home and assets. Some were injured and some were covered by the remains. The tolls have been up to more than 10 million. The government has gathered national emergency troops to rescue them.  \n\nIt is imperative to take the precautions against earthquake for our safety. First, do the earthquake drill and have common sense. In some earthquake-prone areas, people should know how to protect themselves the most in various situations. Then, if one day earthquake really happens to you, you should be calm and run to a vacant space. If you are on the high floors, never take the elevator, hide in your nearest sturdy item as a shelter and wait for the rescue.    \n\n"

Humans can't survive without water, so water is a top priority. Apart from water, food is also an essential and I will add instant food like ship biscuits and instant noodles to my kit to prevent myself from starving. \nTo stay warm and clean, I would prepare some extra sets of clothing, as well as a lightweight thermal blanket and a rainproof poncho and boots.\nKeeping ourselves informed and updated is of critical importance when an emergency strikes.

In Nash Equilibrium, each player's strategy is optimal considering the decisions of other players. The socially optimal solution is a volatile state that brings the maximum collective benefit to the participants. However, the Nash Equilibrium does not always equal the socially optimal solution. Here's an example in game theory called ice cream on the beach.\n  Imagine that you are going to sell ice cream on a beach, opting to place the stall in the middle of the beach to attract all the guests from both the north and the south. At this time, your cousin, Ted, does the same thing you do. So, you move your stall to half of the southern half of the beach, and so does Ted. In fact, this is the socially optimal solution that benefits all guests because they can easily get the ice cream. But you and Ted can both take one step closer to the center to gain a competitive edge over each other and maximize their personal benefit.

After Mufasa's death and Simba's exile, Scar leads hyenas to take over Pride Rock.\nIn my opinion, Simba's father, Mufasa, and the baboon Rafiki, both conform to the mentor archetype. They are wise and calm. While the hero, Simba, is too scared and hesitant to return to Pride Rock due to his past experiences, \n\n"

For instance, if person A had a cow and wanted to exchange it for a glass of beer from person B, B might refuse the deal, considering the cow too large and impractical to re-exchange. This complexity and potential for failed exchanges led people to develop a new system called indirect exchange, which eventually gave rise to the concept of money.\nMoney serves as a medium of exchange, representing and facilitating the transfer of value. It possesses three key characteristics. Firstly, money must be divisible. As seen in the example above, the value of a cow does not align with that of a glass of beer. Therefore, money should be easily divisible into smaller units to accommodate varying values. Secondly, money must be portable. Unlike a cow, which is difficult to carry on and transport, money should be easily carried and used for transactions anywhere.

They have accumulated astounding popularity and influence in today's society through the Internet, especially social media platforms. Becoming an influencer has many benefits, but also comes with some challenges and difficulties.\nThe primary benefit of being an influencer is the economic advantage it offers. They have flexibility to be their own boss and can freely earn more income through advertising, brand cooperation, live streaming rewards, and selling their own products or services. Moreover, they enjoy the support of their fan base which can boost their confidence and satisfaction. Additionally, they can shape their personal brand through social media platforms, laying the foundation for future career development.\nHowever, there are also some difficulties. Firstly, their lives are often exposed to the public, making it difficult to protect personal privacy. Secondly, they may encounter cyberbullying from malicious commentators, which can negatively impact their mental health. Furthermore, they may experience continuous pressure to innovate.

At this time, the cell will receive a signal from the insulin to open up and accept the glucose. Next, the cells can burn the glucose energy. The insulin is just like a parent, commanding the cells, or the children, to do what they need to do. However, sustained excess consumption of carbohydrates can cause cells to become desensitized to the insulin signal. The insulin has to command again and again, just a nagging parent. The cells will have a similar reaction to disobedient children, refusing to take in the glucose. This is what we call insulin resistance. \nWe humans have two main systems to provide energy to the body. One is the fat-burning system, the other is the glucose-burning system. If one has insulin resistance, the cells won't open up and accept the glucose. This impairs the body's ability to burn glucose as energy.

In openness to experience, my score is 64, which means I'm conservative. This result is also very accurate, and I am better at doing some regular work.

The development of the internet created jobs like web developers, programmers, and so on.\nIn conclusion, while automation may eventually lead to technical unemployment, the fear that humans will be put out of a job entirely is unfounded. The road ahead is long and uncertain, and will be filled with both challenges and opportunities. \n\nThe fear of smth is unfounded.\nThe fear of smth has no basis in reality.\n\n\n"

However, women, sometimes, face more challenges in the workplace. Here are some reasons.\n\nFirst of all, some companies provide fewer opportunities and positions to women as they may have babies and need maternity leave, which means the company should pay women for months with no reward. In addition, the big picture of society in China shows that women are likely to spend more time taking care of children than men do. Although laws make it accessible for fathers to paternity leave, the time is too short, only about ten days. So in fact, women continue to bear a heavy burden in raising children, which makes some companies unpeasant to hire women.\n\nSecondly, social stereotypes easily form glass ceilings for women in workplaces that are hard to get rid of. In some countries in Europe and North America, we can find a number of gender equality policies. Nevertheless, because women there have been excluded from science and technology in the past, there is a stereotype in Europe and North America that women can only do certain jobs.

It provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge to obtain good jobs with relatively high salaries and pleasant working environments. However, it is more than that. It is an advanced rehearsal before entering society. A higher education institution is often referred to as a small version of society where students learn how to communicate with various people and to deal with what an adult should do. Especially in a university where you will be surrounded by high-quality individuals, which raises the ceiling of your future work and prepares you for a broader range of challenges. Moreover, a university education can also be seen as a consumption good. During the four years, we experience various cultures, ideas, and perspectives, and the friendships and memories we make cannot be duplicated. It is also a public good that teaches us the right views on the world, life, and values, and a sense of responsibility for the community. It fulfills its function as a status symbol as well.
