What's the difference between a gene and a meme? How do they spread? What information do they carry?

In a word, genes spread vertically, and memes spread horizontally.

Clarify the definition:

A gene is hereditary information...
Genes determine many aspects of your physiology, such as your height, eye color, hair color, and much more.

Narrowly speaking, we often encounter memes on social media in the form of interesting pictures or videos that are spread widely online.

More broadly, Richard Dawkins defined a meme as ""an idea that rips (spreads quickly) through the public consciousness."" 
Simply speaking, a meme is an idea that transmits culture through imitation and replication.

Memes are responsible for the excellent design of human culture.

Memes are like genes, but they are not passed down through parents. They are spread among people.

Genes are passed down from parents to children, whereas...

But I think sometimes, memes can be transmitted vertically. But most of the time, horizontally. Generational gaps may exist between parents and children, hindering the seamless propagation of memes from one generation to the next. Memes are not as easily passed from parents to children because children often learn much more from their peers than from their parents.


People with a shared culture and background can easily understand the memes that go around in the cultural milieu.

The younger generation more easily keeps up with technological trends on the internet and is more sensitive to buzz words. (the next big thing)

Describe the differences between the conjugal (traditional) view of marriage and the revisionist view. What values lie at the core of each view?

Revisionist and Conjugal view on marriage represent two different views on the nature of marital unions.

The revisionist view regards marriage to be primarily an emotional bond between individuals, characterized by romantic love, mutual support, and personal fulfillment. It emphasizes the importance of each partner's agency and values the quality of the relationship with less regard for the limits of traditional structures. In revisionist marriage, the typical marriage vow ""till death do you part"" takes a back seat to ""follow your heart.""

The conjugal view regards marriage as a comprehensive union, encompassing biological, social, and emotional dimensions. It is rooted in people's belief that marriage is primarily a social institution with roles that have been defined long ago. It is often concerned with childrearing and fulfillment of family duties. In the traditional family, everyone has a role to play. The conjugal view emphasizes that the stability of the family forms the foundation of the whole society.

How does social capital help an influencer be successful?

Let's define social capital. It's a form of capital that is based on the relationships people have with others. For an influencer, social capital can consist of relationships with their followers, their reputation, and their trust network. Social capital is usually developed over a long period of time and repeated successful interactions with others.

Strong social capital can be incredibly valuable for influencers as it gives them the ability to effectively market their products or services to their followers. The product recommendations from an influencer with strong social capital are more likely to be warmly received by followers. Good social capital can help an influencer launch collaborations with some companies or brands they want to cooperate with.

In short, a successful influencer learns how to cash in on their social capital by recommending products to their followers.

Why should we trust or not trust the recommendations from an influencer?

When considering products recommended by influencers, it's crucial to assess their motivations. Some influencers genuinely love the products they endorse, but others may be motivated by lucrative deals, partnerships, or sponsorships. We need to evaluate whether their recommendations are objective or influenced by personal feelings. After all, some influencers decide to cash in on their social capital by recommending a product they have not even tried. These influencers sell out their followers and can be regarded as paid shills.

Prioritize your own needs over trends. Reflect on whether the product actually aligns with your needs. Avoid impulse buying and make informed decisions.

In what ways does a Chinese hero differ from an American hero? Can you give one or two examples?

Chinese and American films reflect their respective underlying cultures. The heroes in Chinese and American films differ accordingly.

In American films, such as the Marvel superhero movies, each hero is unique and has special powers. This is one example of how Americans focus more on independence, self-improvement, and personal values.

While in China, people adhere more closely to collectivism and a sense of community. For example, in the film Wandering Earth, the Chinese government proposes ""a community with a shared future for mankind.""This film shows how a harmonious international atmosphere can overcome an existential threat to humanity.

The Chinese film Wolf Warrior puts the Chinese value of patriotism on full display. 
places the Chinese value of patriotism center stage.
To place smth center stage
To put smth on full display
The courageous and independent hero puts forth all his effort in service of the greater good, making an unforgettable contribution and sacrifice for society.

(The hero is courageously independent, but puts his independence to use in service to his country.)

"﻿How would you prepare yourself for a hurricane or rainstorm where there will be no electricity for three days? There could be a lot of water and flooding.

It may be difficult to get your hands on food during a crisis. I would stock up on high-protein, high-calorie foods that have a long shelf life, like peanut butter and canned tuna. These foods will keep me satiated and energized during the crisis.

When the storm hits, a power outage may occur. To see clearly in the dark, I would prepare a crank-charged flashlight with built-in AM/FM radio. That way, I can stay informed of the latest developments announced through the emergency broadcast system.

To stay warm and dry, I would prepare some extra changes of clothing as well as a lightweight thermal blanket and a rain poncho.

Staying in touch with friends and family is critical. To ensure my phone stays powered and connected, I would charge a power bank in advance. If my phone battery becomes drained of power, I can easily plug it into my power bank to recharge it.

To stay hydrated, I would buy a case of bottled water in advance. Just in case, I would also buy some water purification tablets as well.

What things can't you learn at school? What things cannot be taught?
Most knowledge is taught, but some things are unteachable.
Some are born with insightful intuition and deep creativity. These attributes are an innate spark�something you're born with.
Passion and drive are internal motivators that are hard to instill
Life's most important lessons cannot be taught; they can only be learned by experience.
The most profound life lessons come from going through life's ups and downs with a humble heart. Someone who rises to life's highs with a prideful heart and sinks into the lows with a hardened heart will never learn life's profound lessons.
There's a certain depth of understanding from going through life challenges yourself.

What are the aims of the Federal Reserve and what tools does it use to create new money?
Central Banking System of the United States
Maximize employment, stabilize prices, moderate long term interest rates
Open market operations: The Fed prints new money to purchase financial assets such as government and corporate bonds. When the fed buys assets other than government debt, this is called quantitative easing.
Federal Funds Rate: the rate at which banks can borrow funds from the Federal Reserve. When this rate is lower, it encourages lending and investment, indirectly increasing the money supply.
Reserve requirements: the minimum reserves a bank must hold against its deposits. Modern banks engage in fractional reserve banking, which allows the bank to repurpose depositors' funds by lending them out again. However, a bank must hold a certain percentage of depositors' funds on hand in case the depositor wishes to make a withdrawal. In past years, the US Reserve Requirement Ratio was 10%. Now it is 0%. By lowering reserve requirements, the Fed allows banks to lend out a higher percentage of its deposits, thus increasing the money supply.
 
What role do protein, fat, and carbohydrates play in your body? What are some primary sources of each macronutrient?
Three essential macronutrients necessary for the overall health and well-being of our bodies.
Protein helps repair, build, and grow tissues like muscle fibers, and organs like the heart. It's found in foods like yogurt, eggs, and meat, including poultry, seafood, fish, beef, lamb, and pork. Proteins are essential for fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders.
Fat is one of the body's two fuel sources. It provides energy for thinking and moving. We can find fats in dairy, meat, fish and edible oils. Opinions are split about which fats are healthy and which are harmful. Generally speaking, everyone agrees that unsaturated fats from fish and olive oil are healthy. However, vegetable oils have attracted much skepticism. Viewpoints diverge on the health impacts of saturated fat, which is commonly found in dairy, meat, and eggs. Consensus is clear that trans fats are harmful in all cases.
Carbohydrates are another of the body's primary energy providers. Carbohydrates can be found in rice, noodles, flour, legumes and starchy vegetables. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose for energy. The glucose will enter our blood and trigger an increase in insulin, which signals to the cells to intake the glucose from the blood.

In your view, do the benefits of UBI outweigh the risks? Why or why not?
The concept of UBI has attracted widespread attention.
The potential drawbacks significantly outweigh its advantages.
Some UBI advocates say it would supplement existing welfare programs. Others say it would supplant them.
Its universal application ensures everyone receives a basic income, regardless of their employment status, income level, or net worth. The fact that everyone is universally eligible reduces the possibility of someone gaming the system.
Removing the current welfare system's levers and loopholes will foster social cohesion.
UBI can provide a financial cushion for those in need.

The negative side should not be ignored.
The cost would be enormous, requiring significant tax hikes or elimination of other programs. Some UBI proponents advocate for an AI or automation tax to be placed on companies that benefit most from automation.
UBI provides individuals with a guaranteed income, no strings attached.

UBI could cause a labor supply disincentive as some individuals choose to forego employment in favor of living a simple life on UBI.
The implementation of UBI will inevitably lead to economic policy reforms and significant political opposition.
Implementing such a system requires such a substantial investment of human resources, materials, and finances, all of which could be directed toward other more pressing issues.
While UBI has some merits, its drawbacks are too significant to ignore.

Describe what happens in a certain emergency or disaster. What can be done to prepare for the disaster or prevent it?
A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is normally dry. It can occur due to various reasons, but it always starts with heavy rainfall or a coastal storm surge.

When a flood comes, it can damage power lines and cellular towers, causing power outages and poor cellular connectivity.
In order to prepare for a flood, firstly, the government should construct and maintain dams and reservoirs to control the flow of water and reduce the risk of overflow.

The government should build a flood forecasting and warning system to enhance the capability to predict and warn of coming floods and provide valuable time for evacuation. With plenty of advance warning, citizens can leave the flood-prone danger zone in search of higher and dryer ground.

We should develop public awareness and education. Local authorities should educate the public about the risks of flooding and how to prepare for floods. Community emergency response teams (CERT) should be prepared to sandbag critical low-lying areas to direct water away from vulnerable infrastructure. Each household should prepare 72-hour kits containing first aid supplies, crank-powered flashlight and radio, walkie-talkies, high-energy, high-protein food like peanut butter and tuna fish, bottled water, water purification tablets, dry clothing and thermal blankets, and a book to keep you company.

Describe what happens in a certain emergency or disaster. What can be done to prepare for the disaster or prevent it?
A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is normally dry. It can occur due to various reasons, but it always starts with heavy rainfall or a coastal storm surge.

When a flood comes, it can damage power lines and cellular towers, causing power outages and poor cellular connectivity.
In order to prepare for a flood, firstly, the government should construct and maintain dams and reservoirs to control the flow of water and reduce the risk of overflow.

The government should build a flood forecasting and warning system to enhance the capability to predict and warn of coming floods and provide valuable time for evacuation. With plenty of advance warning, citizens can leave the flood-prone danger zone in search of higher and dryer ground.

We should develop public awareness and education. Local authorities should educate the public about the risks of flooding and how to prepare for floods. Community emergency response teams (CERT) should be prepared to sandbag critical low-lying areas to direct water away from vulnerable infrastructure. Each household should prepare 72-hour kits containing first aid supplies, crank-powered flashlight and radio, walkie-talkies, high-energy, high-protein food like peanut butter and tuna fish, bottled water, water purification tablets, dry clothing and thermal blankets, and a book to keep you company.

What things can't you learn at school? What things cannot be taught?
Most knowledge is taught, but some things are unteachable.
Some are born with insightful intuition and deep creativity. These attributes are an innate spark�something you're born with.
Passion and drive are internal motivators that are hard to instill
Life's most important lessons cannot be taught; they can only be learned by experience.
The most profound life lessons come from going through life's ups and downs with a humble heart. Someone who rises to life's highs with a prideful heart and sinks into the lows with a hardened heart will never learn life's profound lessons.
There's a certain depth of understanding from going through life challenges yourself.

What are the aims of the Federal Reserve and what tools does it use to create new money?
Central Banking System of the United States
Maximize employment, stabilize prices, moderate long term interest rates
Open market operations: The Fed prints new money to purchase financial assets such as government and corporate bonds. When the fed buys assets other than government debt, this is called quantitative easing.
Federal Funds Rate: the rate at which banks can borrow funds from the Federal Reserve. When this rate is lower, it encourages lending and investment, indirectly increasing the money supply.
Reserve requirements: the minimum reserves a bank must hold against its deposits. Modern banks engage in fractional reserve banking, which allows the bank to repurpose depositors' funds by lending them out again. However, a bank must hold a certain percentage of depositors' funds on hand in case the depositor wishes to make a withdrawal. In past years, the US Reserve Requirement Ratio was 10%. Now it is 0%. By lowering reserve requirements, the Fed allows banks to lend out a higher percentage of its deposits, thus increasing the money supply.
 
What role do protein, fat, and carbohydrates play in your body? What are some primary sources of each macronutrient?
Three essential macronutrients necessary for the overall health and well-being of our bodies.
Protein helps repair, build, and grow tissues like muscle fibers, and organs like the heart. It's found in foods like yogurt, eggs, and meat, including poultry, seafood, fish, beef, lamb, and pork. Proteins are essential for fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders.
Fat is one of the body's two fuel sources. It provides energy for thinking and moving. We can find fats in dairy, meat, fish and edible oils. Opinions are split about which fats are healthy and which are harmful. Generally speaking, everyone agrees that unsaturated fats from fish and olive oil are healthy. However, vegetable oils have attracted much skepticism. Viewpoints diverge on the health impacts of saturated fat, which is commonly found in dairy, meat, and eggs. Consensus is clear that trans fats are harmful in all cases.
Carbohydrates are another of the body's primary energy providers. Carbohydrates can be found in rice, noodles, flour, legumes and starchy vegetables. Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose for energy. The glucose will enter our blood and trigger an increase in insulin, which signals to the cells to intake the glucose from the blood.

In your view, do the benefits of UBI outweigh the risks? Why or why not?
The concept of UBI has attracted widespread attention.
The potential drawbacks significantly outweigh its advantages.
Some UBI advocates say it would supplement existing welfare programs. Others say it would supplant them.
Its universal application ensures everyone receives a basic income, regardless of their employment status, income level, or net worth. The fact that everyone is universally eligible reduces the possibility of someone gaming the system.

What is insulin resistance and how does it develop?

(talk about the two engines the body uses to burn fuel)

Insulin is a hormone that helps balance glucose levels.
After an individual consumes carbohydrates, blood glucose increases rapidly.
In response, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the cells to intake glucose.
This ensures that glucose levels are maintained within a healthy range.

However, if an individual has metabolic dysfunction or consumes a large amount of carb-heavy food, this process can become disrupted. The cells become less responsive to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is an impairment of the body's ability to use glucose as fuel.

With more and more glucose in the blood, the body tries to produce more insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Eventually, the body cannot produce enough insulin to reduce blood sugar, causing the onset of diabetes. Insulin resistance is one of the most common medical conditions while remaining poorly understood by the general public.

(insulin versus glucagon)

Eating fat and controlling carbohydrate consumption minimizes insulin and boosts glucagon, which transforms fat into ketones, ready to burn as energy. Counterintuitively, in contrast to the popular adage, ""you are not what you eat.""

How do Western and Eastern approaches to education differ?
Dominance of public school and compulsory education. Education is compulsory for all children.
Diverse educational options are available in the West. Private schools, homeschooling, unschooling.
Classroom composition. Students are segregated by academic ability and typically stick with a constant class of 20-30 students. In the West, all students of a geographic area attend the same school. Students interact with hundreds of peers randomly.
Curriculum focus. In the East: English and math. In the West: a broader focus on extracurricular activities such as�
School environment: In the East: highly academic, with strict rules against dating and other social distractions. In the West: more socially oriented. Activities such as dances, parties, and clubs are common. Dating is generally accepted in high school.
School hours and after-school activities: In the East: School can go late into the evening. Students spend their time studying. When not studying, they might surf the internet, play games, or hang out with friends. In the US, school ends around 3 pm, giving students freedom to engage in various activities such as�

What can you do personally to be better prepared for an emergency?
To be better prepared for an emergency, we need to stay abreast of developments in your area and create an emergency plan in advance. Map out the evacuation routes so you know where to seek safety. When disaster strikes, it's important to stay calm and take quick action. A preparedness kit can be extremely helpful when you are stuck without water and power.
What will you put in your kit?
I would stock up on enough food and water, including high-protein, high-calorie foods, such as compressed biscuits, and protein shakes to energize myself. I would be sure to store a pack of bottled water on-hand to keep myself hydrated.
Extra changes of clothing are also important in case we get soaked/drenched in a rainstorm and need to change to something warm and dry. A coat or a blanket can help us keep warm. A life jacket can keep us afloat in flood waters. It's also important to keep in touch with family and friends. A large-capacity charging bank can recharge a phone after a long day of phone usage.
Medical equipment will certainly come in handy. A first aid kit should be equipped with bandages, medicines, etc. for sudden health problems.
Lastly, you can prepare some pepper spray or other self-defense items to ward off potential assailants.

What would happen if no one needed to work thanks to a generous UBI?
If UBI were implemented at a level sufficient to meet everyone's basic needs and no one needed to work anymore, several potential outcomes could arise, both positive and negative.
Positive:
Increase freedom and creativity. People would have the freedom to pursue their hobbies, passions, and interests without the pressure to make a living.
A surge in creativity, innovation, and artistic expression.
Could improve mental health by reducing financial stress and job insecurity. The financial safety net of UBI could protect many from the devastating effects of unemployment.
Negative:
May cause a labor shortage in essential services and industries that are less desirable but crucial for society's functioning such as healthcare and maintenance.
It can also negatively impact the economy. Some propose to secure the outlays for UBI by taxing corporations who benefit the most from automation. No matter how the funds are procured, government spending will inevitably rise.

A growth in disposable income without increasing the amount of goods in circulation could result in inflation. In other words, more money chasing fewer goods means higher prices.

Why might someone in China or America be interested in homeschooling?
In the US, homeschooling is a common educational approach supported by law. American parents choose homeschooling to provide a customized education that fits their child's needs. It's believed that homeschooled kids can achieve more and score higher than kids in the public school system. Additionally, homeschool provides a safer environment, isolated from the evils of racism, abuse, drugs, alcohol, and other traps. Parents of minority children want to protect them from the tyranny of low expectations. Homeschool can also provide opportunity for religious families to instill religious values in their children and approach learning from a religious point of view.

In China, homeschooling is less common because the law mandates compulsory education through the ninth grade. Nevertheless, parents who are dissatisfied with the exam-focused education system may choose to homeschool their kids. They want an educational program to put their kids on a fast track to success and prepare their kids to study abroad.

"﻿What are some ways to effectively build trust between two people?
There are two types of trust: task-based trust and relationship-based trust. Understand the culture of the person you are working with. If they come from a culture where relationship-based trust is dominant, consider finding ways to strengthen personal ties. If they come from a culture where task-based trust is dominant, do your best to be punctual, efficient, and professional in your business communications.

Secondly, develop character traits that make it easier for others to trust you.
Strive for self-disclosure and be open about your motivations, concerns, and uncertainties.
Be honest. Tell the truth about your beliefs and intentions.
Get to know others and let them get to know you.
Be transparent. You should share complete, timely, and accurate information.
Encourage each other. Don't compete with each other. Don't demean or belittle others.
Be willing to learn and improve. Be open to new ideas and welcome challenges to your way of thinking.

Evolution of Trust takeaways:
Seek repeat interactions. 
Look for possible win-wins
Minimize miscommunication. Miscommunication can destroy/erode trust.

Aim for complete sentences.

The Broken Window Fallacy illustrates that damage is not beneficial to the economy.
A man's windows were broken. He asked the glassmaker to repair his window in exchange for six francs. The townspeople comforted him, saying ""paying the glassmaker puts money into the economy, benefitting us all!""But if we analyze the story from another angle, if the window hadn't been broken, the man could have bought a pair of shoes. But since the window was broken, the man can only use the money to repair the window.

The Broken Window Fallacy illustrates that damage is not beneficial to the economy.
The story goes as follows: A shopkeeper's son throws a rock through the shop window, shattering it into pieces. He paid the glazier six francs to repair his window. The townspeople reassured him, saying ""look on the bright side! Every cloud has a silver lining. Buying a new window from the glazier gives him money to spend elsewhere, like the wine merchant or the bakery. Putting six francs into the circular economy stimulates consumption."" But if we analyze the story from another angle, we come to a different conclusion. If the window hadn't been broken, the man could have bought a pair of shoes. In turn, the six francs spent on shoes would have also entered the circular economy, stimulating consumption. In both scenarios, we end up with an intact window. The difference between the scenarios is the pair of shoes that appears if the window hadn't been broken.
	The townspeople overlooked the impact of the broken window because they never saw what could have been: a new pair of shoes. This is the opportunity cost of breaking the window, and it remains in the shadows, unseen. This example teaches us the importance of paying attention to the unseen opportunity cost of every decision.

Individualism vs collectivism
Hofstede's cultural dimensions is a framework for understanding cultural differences across countries. Hofstede's six dimensions include individualism, power distance, masculinity, time orientation, indulgence, and uncertainty avoidance. A country's score on these six dimensions is a snapshot of its values and gives a rationale behind the behavior of its citizens. For example, the tendency of Chinese people to prioritize the needs of the group is shown by China's low score on individualism.

Individualism is an emphasis on the importance of individual interests. Chinese culture trends toward collectivism, prioritizing interpersonal connections and relationships that form the foundation of Confucian values.

A common Chinese proverb goes, ""many hands make light work."" This proverb suggests the power of collective strength. A prime example is how Chinese people banded together to follow health rules and guidelines. They figuratively linked arms and fought off the pandemic to maintain public health. This displays the strong collectivistic nature of Chinese society.

Conversely, American culture inclines toward individualism, stressing personal development, achievement, and rights. American culture also values self-reliance. During the pandemic, individuals had the right to decide whether to wear a mask or not. Individual states could choose whether or not to implement national public health guidance. Other individuals took responsibility to strengthen their own health and be prepared for the time when they would contract COVID. This is one example of self-reliance.

What are the differences between the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Big Five?
MBTI and Big Five are two tests that measure your personality traits.
MBTI is a binary test with four dimensions: The first dimension is Extraversion versus Introversion: how do you get your energy? The second dimension is Sensing versus Intuition: how you see the world? The third dimension is Thinking versus feeling: how do you make decisions? And the fourth dimension is Judging versus Perceiving: how do you plan ahead? You can take these as your four main crutches to understand your own personality. For example, my personality type is INTJ, and I think this personality type accurately describes my personality.

Psychologists don't consider MBTI to be scientifically valid for several reasons. First of all, the MBTI presents you with a binary result. Either you're an introvert or an extravert. In reality, people may fall somewhere between the two extremes. Personality is not black and white, it's a spectrum. Secondly, the dimensions measured by MBTI were conceived by theory, not practice. This means there's no data or evidence to prove that there are only four dimensions to personality, or that the dimensions really are what the creators conceived of. For this reason, we can consider MBTI to be a useful framework for analyzing personality, but not necessarily comprehensive or conclusive.

On the other hand, the Big Five model was developed by a linguistic approach, with the assumption that words are a window to the nature of a person. Researchers used factor analysis to statistically group thousands of descriptors into five dimensions that independently co-vary. This means that each dimension is reliably separate from other dimensions.

The five dimensions of the Big Five model are conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion. Some say that the Big Five is a value-laden framework, meaning that it's better to score low or high on a certain dimension. But value is in the eye of the beholder. Someone high in neuroticism could either be a drug addict or Steve Jobs. From this example, I assert that the Big Five doesn't need to be value-laden.

Psychologists also prefer the Big Five's assessment of personality on a spectrum rather than a binary result. A spectrum of personality better reflects reality.

	
Explain nash equilibrium and socially optimal solution using an example of �

Nash equilibrium and socially optimal solution are both important concepts in game theory. Nash equilibrium is a situation when no player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally. Socially optimal solution is a situation when all participants get the most collective benefit.

Hotelling's Model of Spatial Competition can help us visualize these concepts. Imagine you sell ice cream on the beach. You choose the middle of the beach because you can reach the widest range of customers from that position. One day, another vendor arrives, selling the same ice cream as you. You both agree to occupy the quarter-position on each side of the beach. This is the socially optimal solution because it minimizes the distance any beachgoer has to walk to buy ice cream. But this solution is unstable because each ice cream vendor is incentivized to move closer to the center of the beach to maximize personal interests.

When your competitor chooses to move toward the center of the beach, you are also incentivized to move to the center of the beach. The result is a Nash equilibrium, where neither of you can benefit from moving out from the center. This Nash equilibrium is stable because if one of you moves out from the center, your selling area will shrink. Therefore, both vendors will likely remain in the center of the beach for the foreseeable future.

Jayne - What role do protein, fat, and carbohydrates play in your body? What are some primary sources of each macronutrient?
Protein is an important component of cells and tissues of the human body and is associated with basic living actions and even immune system work. Protein mainly comes from meat, eggs, beans and milk products (such as cheese). For carnivores, their protein intake comes exclusively from meat. Vegetarians consume protein through beans and eggs. However, vegans are more strict, and will not consume any animal products, including eggs.Fat exists in the human body as one of the most important sources of energy with other functions such as maintaining temperature and protecting internal organs. Gram-for-gram, fat provides more than double the amount of energy as carbs. In addition, consuming fat does not trigger an insulin response and does not raise blood sugar. Fat can be burned over a longer period of time than carbohydrates, and is more satiating. There are many kinds of different fats, and most of them can be found in animal foods, nuts and various oils.Carbohydrates are the main source of energy needed to sustain life's activities. Carbs provide calories to the human body by stimulating insulin, which signals to the body to store glucose in its cells. The major sources of carbohydrates include ingredients like sugar and starchy foods such as bread, cereal and so on. People on a carnivore or keto diet minimize or eliminate carb consumption entirely.

To prepare for a car crash: obey traffic rules. Having a knowledge of the traffic rules is important. Government should introduce policies to force public to obey traffic rules. Rules can prevent disasters from happening.
In an earthquake, tectonic plates grind against each other, which cause vibrations on earth's surface. For individuals, the only thing they can do to prepare is to stock up on food storage and assemble 72-hour kits. They can also develop a family disaster plan to help their families ... teach their children how to respond in the case of an earthquake. Once an earthquake hits, your preparation will be put to the test. Did the buildings remain standing? Did the water lines remain unruptured? Ruptured water lines can contaminate drinking water and make living extremely difficult. Government should mandate earthquake drills in elementary and middle schools regularly.

Crystal - What are the aims of the Fed and what tools does it use to create new money?
The Federal Reserve has several jobs: maximize employment, stabilize prices, (prevent inflation and deflation), and to moderate long-term interest rates.
The Fed has three main tools to accomplish this.
In open market operations, the Fed will create new money to purchase assets, mainly government treasuries. This process is called quantitative easing.
The second tool is the discount rate. This is the short-term borrowing rate between banks. The lower the rate, the easier it is to borrow money.
The third tool is the reserve requirement ratio. Previously, a bank was required to keep on hand a certain percent of customers' deposits, for example, 10%. Now, the reserve requirement ratio in the U.S. is zero, meaning the bank can lend out all the money that was deposited by other customers. This is also known as fractional reserve banking.
The end result of all these measures is to inject more money into the economy and stimulate consumption.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout caused by the lockdowns, the Fed has printed trillions of dollars, increasing the money supply by 40% in just one year. Originally, the Fed assumed that this would not trigger an inflationary spike. However, we are now seeing strong inflation return in the United States and around the world.
Some experts pin the blame on Vladimir Putin. Due to the sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, the price of oil has skyrocketed. This has contributed to record-breaking inflation last seen in the 1970s. Others state that the inflation has nothing to do with Putin, but is a simple result of boundless money printing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"﻿What is the gender paradox and what could be two explanations for it?
Situation
The gender paradox is that countries with gender-equality policies actually have fewer women in STEM than those countries without gender-equality policies.

Implementing gender-equality policies does not cause more women to choose STEM careers.

Two possible explanations are related to choice and culture.
In gender-equal countries, life satisfaction is higher, so people don't have to prioritize economic interests when choosing a career. Instead, people can do whatever they want to do. Then, career choice becomes a matter of personal preference, which may be influenced by biological factors.

The second explanation is cultural. In some countries, including Western Europe and America, stereotypes preventing women from entering STEM fields have persisted for centuries.

In other countries with no gender-equality policies, there are no stereotypes preventing women from entering STEM fields.

Benefits and challenges of globalization:
Globalization is the trend of growing interconnectedness and exchange of people, goods, ideas, and money across the globe. Although globalization has some drawbacks, it's generally believed that globalization is a rising tide that lifts all boats.

With globalization, all countries have easy access to important technologies, such as smart phones, computers, electric vehicles, and the Internet.

Globalization increase each country's  GDP as that country exports its goods on the global market.
Thanks to globalization, everyone can enjoy a higher living standard/quality of life.

Globalization means greater interdependence between countries. As countries specialize in their own competitive advantage, they rely on other countries for goods and services outside their core competencies.

Globalization can increase cultural exchange and promote understanding between people of different cultures. As people travel around the world, they begin to understand their place in humanity and on the Earth.

Drawbacks:
Globalization can exacerbate the problem of inequality by benefitting super-wealthy plutocrats at the expense of the working class. It makes the rich richer, but does it make the poor poorer?

Globalization has an apparent impact on the environment. As countries industrialize to meet the demands of globalization, they produce byproducts that do harm to nature, such as plastic packaging, waste water, and toxic gases.

Globalization makes countries vulnerable due to excessive dependence on each other. For example, Germany recently experienced sky-high energy costs after the eruption of the Russia-Ukraine war, due to the shutdown of gas pipelines from Russia to Germany.

Rai stones:
Rai stones are large circular stones, about the height of a human, which were used as money on the Micronesian island of Yap.
The Yapese people valued rai stones highly due to their unforgeable nature. Why were they unforgeable? These rai stones were quarried from the limestone which was exclusively found on a faraway island. It took hundreds of men on rafts to cut the stones and transport them back to the island of Yap.
Because of their cumbersome size, ownership was recorded orally. That means whenever someone wanted to make a transaction, everyone must be present to hear the chief announce the transaction.

Production and transportation were massively costly, so these stones were valued highly.

The transaction process was prone to errors.

Eventually, European explorers found the island and used advanced technology to easily extract many rai stones at a cheap cost. Over time, the once scarce rai stones became a common commodity and were demonetized.

Aggry beads:
Aggry beads are colorful glass beads that were first used as money in West Africa as early as the 15th century. Glassmaking technology was scarce and expensive in Africa, making these beads a rarity. For that reason, they functioned well as a store of value. Furthermore, they were portable and represented different denominations. This made them an effective medium of exchange.

However, colonial Europeans exploited the people of West Africa by manufacturing fake beads at a low cost. With the power to easily create money, the European colonizers bought up land, resources, and even people. For that reason, the beads eventually came to be known as slave beads.

How does somebody's age influence their desire to live in the countryside or the city?
I believe that as a person's life priorities shift from curiosity and ambition to health and security, they desire less to live in the city and more to live in the countryside.

Adjectives:
Urban
Rural

Nouns:
City, metropolis
Countryside, rural area

Young people are brimming with curiosity and ambition. They are ready to take on the world. The city is full of job opportunities for those who seek them. The city also offers better transportation infrastructure, allowing young people to get around quickly and chase their dreams.

The city also offers easy access to convenient services like healthcare, business services, and government offices. These services make it easier for young people to earn their living.

Older: live in the rural
As people age, their focus shifts toward living a healthy lifestyle. The countryside has cleaner air and water, and food comes fresh from the farm. Elderly people who prize health will find it easy to live a healthy lifestyle in the countryside.
Living in the countryside also gives people peace of mind. Seniors can go to the countryside to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.

What is the history of Statistical Machine Translation? How does it work?

Although machine translation broadly has been practiced since the 1950s, the statistical approach dates back to the 1990s.

Several technological innovations paved the way for the first use of statistical machine translation.
The 1990s saw the emergence of personal computers and the development of the internet. Data storage and transmission bandwidth jumped ahead by leaps and bounds.
Engineers at a search engine company called Google indexed or mapped the entire internet. They found that some webpages are translations of other webpages. They aligned the webpages to make bilingual corpora.

The statistical machine translation
The statistical machine translation engine/system


They had a hypothesis. Before that time, people needed to tell the machine translation engine the rules to translate. However, the engineers at Google wanted the machine translation engine to learn the rules by itself. They fed the engine with millions of segments of bilingual data. The engine then broke down the segments into pieces called n-grams. The engine then analyzed the occurrence of each n-gram to statistically predict the most probable translation.

I like to eat apples.
???????
5-grams: I like to eat apples
4-grams: I like to eat, like to eat apples
3-grams: I like to, like to eat, to eat apples
2-grams: I like, like to, to eat, eat apples
1-grams: I, like, to, eat, apples

4-grams: ??????
3-grams: ????, ?????
2-grams: ???, ???, ???
1-grams: ?, ??, ?, ??

With this statistical model, the user can ask the statistical machine translation engine for a translation, and it will produce the statistically most probable translation.

What made gold an effective form of money?
To understand why gold was an effective form of money, we must first understand the three key characteristics of money itself: divisibility (money's ability to be divided into smaller denominations), portability (money's ability to be easily transported and transacted), and store of value (money's ability to preserve purchasing power over time).

Gold has these characteristics in abundance. Gold is divisible into small units. For very small denominations, silver was used instead. Silver and gold had a stable exchange rate.

Gold was relatively portable, especially if you stored it in a bank vault and transacted with banknotes or IOUs representing gold.

Finally, gold historically has preserved purchasing power very well. That's due in large part to its stock to flow ratio. Gold is difficult to produce in large quantities relative to its existing stock. Gold's stock to flow ratio is 66 years, which is much higher than silver or platinum. That means it would take 66 years to mine enough gold to double today's stock.

For that reason, gold's supply is nearly impossible to manipulate. This makes gold a good store of value.

The gold standard was when in the 1870s, almost all European countries accepted the value of gold, and pegged the value of their currencies to gold. Gold is a form of sound money which is resistant to manipulation.

So, why don't we transact in gold today? During the post-WWII Bretton Woods System, all global currencies were pegged to the dollar and the dollar was pegged to gold. But the United States exploited its position by printing more dollars than it had gold in the vaults. Eventually, many countries, including France, woke up to the scam and demanded gold in return for dollars.

As countries redeemed their dollars for gold, the US gold reserves began to dry up. Nixon prevented a global economic crisis by ""closing the gold window,"" ending the dollar's convertibility to gold. Since then, all global currencies have lost their peg to gold and their value is free-floating.

Plagues of prosperity

We are sick. Heart disease. Cancer. Alzheimer's. Diabetes. They all have one thing in common.

Each of them is caused or exacerbated by insulin resistance. Odds are you have insulin resistance. It is the most common disorder worldwide. It affects more than half of all Americans.

Exacerbated: made worse

It's not a coincidence that insulin resistance is the most common disorder worldwide and heart disease is the most common cause of death worldwide.

Alzheimer's disease is strongly connected with insulin resistance. It's an extension of Type II diabetes.

As the body becomes insulin resistant, its ability to utilize glucose for fuel is diminished.

Body fat is strongly connected with insulin resistance. The most efficient way to fatten a human was to include abundant amounts of food that increase insulin.

What's the clear, simple solution?

We must control insulin to control metabolic health.
metabolism: your body's ability to burn fuel for energy.

A scientifically sound strategy is to control intake of macronutrients.

Three conclusions:
1. Control carbohydrates
If it comes in a bag or box, avoid it.
Sugar is terrible.
If you want to enjoy fruit, eat it, don't drink it.
2. Prioritize protein.
1-1.5g protein per kg body weight.

3. Stop fearing fat. We eat less fat now than ever before. Fat is a remarkable energy source because it can feed our bodies but not our fat.

If you eat fat, will you get fat? The simple answer is no. With this understanding, we can adapt an old adage: ""We aren't what we eat."" 

Test what you learn. Try it for a month. Make it practical.

""Eat less and exercise more"" will only result in a constant battle against hunger, and hunger usually wins.

It's not as much about how much you eat, but about what kinds of food you eat.

"﻿UBI in Korea - The Youth Basic Income Project in Gyeonggi-do
July 13, 2023 
With the concern regarding inequality and unemployment rising in South Korea, the Korean government is looking to innovate its existing redistribution strategy. There is a growing concern not just in South Korea, but around the world, that monopolies, automation, and AI technology will disrupt the labor force indefinitely. UBI (Universal Basic Income) is considered one of the most ambitious social policies of our time. Some of its renowned advocates include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook, Tesla Founder Elon Musk, and former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang. UBI in Korea started in  Gyeonggi-do (Province Surround Seoul) with the Youth Basic Income Program.
There are many test trials happening all across the world. More and more countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare. Gyeonggi-do has been operating a basic income system called Youth Basic Income. It is the 3rd largest basic income policy in the world and is being used to support young people in Gyeonggi-do that are having a hard time finding employment. In addition, Gyeonggi has established its own local currency in 31 counties and cities within Gyeonggi-do province.
UBI in Korea to Help Fight Youth Unemployment in Korea
The most common form of UBI is to give every citizen enough money to be above the poverty line. UBI in Korea has been a hot topic since 2016. South Korea has even implemented several small-scale basic income experiments run by local provinces. Back in 2019, Gyeonggi-do started the Youth Basic Income Project. It focused on paying every 24-year-old in Gyeonggi-do a basic income. The goal was to help them develop their skills so they could figure out how they will contribute to society.
Many 24-year-olds have massive pressure in Korea to find a job as quickly as possible after they graduate from university. Many don't fully know what they want to do in life. Therefore, a vast majority end up working for a company they don't care about. This can lead to depression and a lack of motivation. With the Youth Basic Income, they can now focus more on their studies or passions. For example, many can volunteer or take on social projects while they figure out what they want to do with their life.
The Youth Basic Income Project in Gyeonggi-do
There are 175,000 24-year-olds in Gyeonggi-do. Through the Youth Basic Income project, they are paid approximately $900 dollars a year (1 million won) in local currency. The local currency can be spent like cash within Gyeonggi-do. Therefore, it not only provided a basic level of income for the youth but also helped support local businesses as the money did not leave Gyeonggi-do. This is the beauty of UBI programs as it stimulates economies and increases consumption. As Andrew Yang points out, it is a trickle-up economy. The Youth Basic Income project has become the most popular policy in the province. They were even able to get actress Cho Yeo-jeong who played Mrs. Park in the Oscar-winning Korean film Parasite to do a TV commercial for basic income in Gyeonggi-do, a place she grew up in as a teenager.
If the data from the program shows promise, there is a high likelihood that this program will be implemented for all individuals in Gyeonggi-do. If we take it a step further and Gyeonggi-do shows positive results from the expanded version of the UBI, Korea will be one step closer to having Universal Basic Income in Korea.
So why start with 24-year-olds for the Youth Basic Income Project?
In Korea, 24-year-olds have just graduated from their university and are looking to enter the job market. However, many have to take additional courses or internships to improve their resume and develop the necessary skills to get a job. Furthermore, with the increase in automation and AI, the job market in Korea is extremely competitive. Therefore Gyeonggi-do decided to run the program for 24-year-olds specifically but will look to expand the program in the future. For now, this program is to help these youths and alleviate some of the pressures of early adult life.
The amount they get (approximately $900) is not enough to live on. However, the positive psychological benefits it provides can't be measured. Furthermore, these 24-year-olds will now have access to a vast selection of educational lessons online to further develop their skills in whatever field they are interested in. Online education has grown so much in Korea that with the Youth Basic Income, these 24-year-olds will be able to gain access to workshops, seminars, and certifications in high-paying industries.
In addition, early results show that participants are more interested in politics than before. This is because they are able to see firsthand the benefits the government can provide.
Gyeonggi-do is leading the way in regard to UBI in Korea. They are constantly looking to develop and expand their programs. They will continue the Youth Basic Income project and look to develop a new program that will help resident farmers in Gyeonggi-do.
How did Gyeonggi-do Fund their UBI?
Is it economically feasible? What about inflation? Will products and services in Gyeonggi-do rise in price? These are typically the questions many critics ask when it comes to UBI projects in Korea. The Youth Basic Income project was not done by printing money but rather through a land possession tax. They collected tax from real estate and paid it back to the people. Therefore, this did not lead to inflation. Gyeonggi-do does not see this as a welfare program but rather an investment into their future through their youth. They want to encourage entrepreneurship and new technologies because this will ultimately lead to job creation.
The Future of Universal Basic Income in Korea
Korea already has a welfare system that needs innovation. Taxpayer money is already going into this current system. Universal Basic Income in Korea can end these welfare systems. Just by shifting the funds, UBI in Korea can easily be financed. Governments around the world have proven they are not efficient with money.
In Korea, unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached. This includes paperwork, taking part in courses, and showing proof of applying to a certain number of jobs a month. Once they find a job, they will lose their benefits. Therefore there is less incentive to find a job. However, if citizens in Korea were getting a UBI which would be an add-on, there will be a higher incentive to find work. Also, an argument could be made that time could be much better spent looking for the right kind of job. In addition, it will allow more freedom to continue their education, or start their own business/startup.

"﻿Online discourse has never been more fragmented and conflict-ridden. Every Twitter handle loudly proclaims the moral stance of its holder, shouting to the world whether they support Ukraine or Russia,  Lockdown-ism or freedom, scientism or religion, Yankees or Knicks, Golden State Warriors or LA Lakers, or even carnivory or veganism.
People are divided along more lines than ever. Some of the most contentious divisions lie along racial and cultural lines. Many seek to embolden one side against another. Blacks against whites. Whites against blacks. Republicans against Democrats. Democrats against Republicans.
In such a contentious culture, many point to a need for more calm and civility. ""If only we could be nicer to each other. If only we could have a rational conversation. If only we could sit down side by side and bridge our differences.""
Others take the opposite view: opponents deserve nothing short of vigorous trolling. Give them the memes. Take the fight to them. Never relent. Flood them with propaganda. Taking a step back and viewing the contentious social situation, who in their right mind could advocate for more conflict? How on earth could the right decision be more trolling?
Is it possible that trolling and memes could be the right thing during this contentious age? I will argue yes.
Firstly, we must recognize that the internet has brought upon us an information overload. No human mind has the capacity to parse through all the data and news being constantly released to stay on top of it. How could one ever claim to understand all that is happening in our world? In my view, the world is just too complex to begin to comprehend what's going on.
A flood of information has the same effect as a drought of information: people inevitably take sides and build tribes. Communities unite around Schelling points - powerful ideological gathering points that organize the behavior and goals of their followers. Well-recognized ideological Schelling points include the environmental movement, what I call the ""vaxxism"" movement, the anti-vax movement, allegiance toward Russia, allegiance toward Ukraine, the capitalist ideology, the socialist ideology. Various religions have strong influence in the modern age, especially Christianity, Islam, and atheism. Young people often rally to the cry of Black Lives Matter, or the LGBT movement, or the feminist movement. Others seek to wage memetic battle in the world of finance by supporting this or that cryptocurrency.
There are simply endless causes to unite oneself to and fight for. There's not enough time to figure out who's right and who's wrong. Can we expect that all these sides can just sit down and have a rational conversation? I highly doubt it.
Instead, I believe that the differences between these ideologies are being resolved on a different playing field: the memetic playing field. He who controls the memes controls the world. Promoting a logical conversation will do nothing if your opponent obliterates your position with a devastating meme, even if it's not accurate!
What determines how people take up sides? I believe that people make decisions not primarily based on logic, but based on rhetoric. Which side has the more immediately convincing arguments? Which side seems cooler? Better? Stronger? This is determined not by logical discussion, but by memes.

"﻿	Vegetable oil first appeared on the American market in the early 1900s. After Proctor and Gamble developed methods for transforming the husks of cottonseeds into soap, they discovered that the soap resembled lard, and could be sold as a replacement for animal fat. The company launched a marketing campaign aimed at replacing animal fats with their new product made from industrial seed oils called Crisco. The campaign was massively successful.
	Heart disease was a rarity before the 1920s, but with cases on the rise, Americans began to pay more and more attention. After president Eisenhower had a heart attack, public attention was fixated on heart disease and its possible causes. Although Eisenhower was a chain smoker, blame was laid at the feed of saturated fats, the type of fat common in butter, cream, tallow, and lard. According to nutritionist Ancel Keys, Americans were consuming too much saturated fat.
	A particularly effective, but misleading meme emerged which envisioned saturated fat as hot oil being poured down a cold pipe. One undoubtedly visualizes the oil sticking to the sides of the pipe, turning solid, and coagulating into a blob of solid mass, preventing the flow of anything through the pipe. This meme spread like wildfire among the American public, which in short time radically decreased its consumption of saturated fats.
	But what to replace it with? Proctor and Gamble paid the American Heart Association millions of dollars to promote its so-called healthy alternative to saturated fat: vegetable oil. Deceptively named, it is actually made from the industrial byproduct of seeds, through an extensive and grueling chemical and heat process. The result is a clear-looking liquid, which by its looks, is totally safe to consume. However, this is far from the truth.
	Vegetable oils contain a high ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These molecules have several ""bends"" in the molecule, due to the missing hydrogens at several points. The names ""omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid"" refer to this distinction of how many bends are in the molecule. Because of these bends, the oil is easily broken down into sub-molecules when heated to high temperatures.
	After switching from animal fats to vegetable oil, restaurants have been experiencing cleaning problems with grungy oil getting stuck to the floors, walls, ceilings, and surfaces of the kitchen. This grunge is not just oil - it is the broken-down polymers resulting from heating vegetable oil. These polymers have the same effect as varnish for furniture. What's more, uniforms saturated with vegetable oil have been known to spontaneously combust in storage bins or dryers. The broken-down polymers of vegetable oils have been known to cause many diseases. It's likely that vegetable oil is one of the culprits behind the American chronic disease and obesity epidemic.
	After all, consumption of vegetable oil has increased dramatically since the 1950s, at a rate higher than any other food product. With such a dramatic rise in rates of chronic disease and obesity, there's only one food product whose consumption matches such a trajectory: vegetable oil.

"﻿Weather: Temperate Marine Climate.
It's always wet, rainy and cloudy. The weather is changeable and hard to forecast. British say weather forecast is a joke in the UK.
In middle Winter, due to the high latitude, the Sun rises at 8am and goes down at 3:30 pm. The sunshine could be valuable. 
In Summer, on the contrary, we can see the Sun rises at 5 to 6 am and it goes down at 9pm. (The darkness is valuable then.)
The average temperature in Winter is usually above 0? and that in Summer is usually no higher than 23?. You will find there is no air conditioner in British's houses. Even the supermarket doesn't sell AC. However, the peak temperature in Summer of the UK is becoming higher in recent years (sometimes near 30?), causing many deaths.

Traffic: 
Railway: Britain has a well-developed railway network. And High-speed railway network is being built in England.
As for cars: It could be strange for most of us who get used the driving way in China and the US � people drive alongside the left. And vehicles there are like this:

Language: 
British English is the universe language in the UK.
Scottish speak Scottish Gaelic. People in Northern Ireland speak Irish Gaelic. People in Wales speak Cymraeg. These three languages are faced with a dilemma that few youngsters in those countries can master their mother tongue.
For Chinese students we learn the differences between American English(AmE) and British English(BrE). Hence, we may easily recognise words from AmE and BrE. However, for (some) British, they don't know AmE. One day I went to supermarket and asked salesclerk where were eggplants, but they didn't know what ""eggplant"" were�I was confused and described the colour and shape of this common vegetable. She understood and told me they were called ""aubergine"" � SAME thing happened when I mixed the words ""holiday"" and ""vacation"" in a dialog with a local Englishman. 12

About England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the UK
Here is a picture:

The UK
The United Kingdom is an independent country off the northwestern coast of Europe. It consists of the entire island of Great Britain and a northern part of the island of Ireland. In fact, the official name of the country is the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.""
The creation of the United Kingdom heralds back to 1801 when the unification between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland led to the establishment of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. When southern Ireland gained independence in the 1920s, the name of the modern country then became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
Great Britain 
Great Britain is the name of the island northwest of France and east of Ireland. Much of the United Kingdom consists of the island of Great Britain. On the large island of Great Britain, there are three somewhat autonomous regions: England, Wales, and Scotland. 
England occupies the southeast portion of the island of Great Britain, Wales is in the southwest, and Scotland is in the north. Scotland and Wales are not independent countries but do have some discretion from the United Kingdom with respect to internal governance. 
England
While England has traditionally been thought of as the heart of the United Kingdom, some use the term ""England"" to refer to the entire country, however, this is not correct.
Ireland 
A final note on Ireland. The northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland is the administrative region of the United Kingdom known as Northern Ireland. The remaining southern five-sixths of the island of Ireland is the independent country known as the Republic of Ireland (Eire). 
Since unification, the Union Jack flag has combined elements of England, Scotland, and Ireland (although Wales is omitted) to represent the unification of constituent parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

"﻿New app advertises free food events on campus
By Kelsey Snowden

Two students have found a way to get free food on campus.
David Hepworth and Chase Roberts, founders of the BYU Lunch Box application, have made finding food around campus easier for students.

""There are a lot of events on campus that offer free food, but because of a limited ability to reach out to all students not everyone gets the message,"" Hepworth said. ""The app helps to put the message of free food giveaways or organization events in one easy and quick accessible place � on your cell phone or computer.""
The cell phone app, which was launched two weeks ago, already has a little over 400 student downloads, and both Hepworth and Roberts predict that by the end of the month, 1,000 students will download it.
The app is free to download and helps promote clubs and organizations, featuring a list of events that are offering free food.
Dave Conley, who is studying molecular biology, first heard about the BYU Lunch Box app in his physics class after he saw information about the app written on the whiteboard.
""I like how this app makes students aware of free food on campus and also informs students of events,"" Conley said. ""This app, I feel, raises awareness of organizations and clubs that some students may have never known existed.""
As many college students know, free food is always a plus of college life, but do organizations and clubs feel taken advantage of when students just drop in for a bite and leave right after?
Jonathan Shumway, an officer of the BYU Pre-med Club, hesitated when he first heard about the app.
""When I first heard about the app from David, who asked if he could advertise that the (pre-med) club was having free pizza, I had my doubts,"" Shumway said. ""I felt students would only come for the food. After thinking more about it, I realized that the app was a great publicity tool and would build awareness of our club.""
The app's format provides lists of upcoming events, what food will be offered, which organizations are sponsoring them and when they will take place. The app also displays the events weeks in advance so students can plan their schedules accordingly.
The BYU Lunch Box app isn't just for students with smartphones. Students without smartphones can receive updates on free food events on campus through the BYU Lunch Box website, Facebook page or Twitter.
""We want our app to be available to every student, and by putting it online we can reach students who don't have smartphones, allowing students without smartphones to receive updates on upcoming food events on campus,"" Hepworth said.
Hepworth and Roberts strive to make the app more user friendly and are constantly looking for ways to improve it. Recently, they had an idea of allowing students to click on an ""I'm attending"" button so clubs and organizations know how much food to plan for.
""We feel that something like this can reduce stress and help organizations and clubs plan the right amount of food and space they need to fit the needs of the event,"" Roberts said.
Hepworth and Roberts, who anticipate graduation in the near future, hope their app will become big enough that students will update it regularly about free food events without their help.
""Our hope is that this app will continue after we leave BYU,"" Roberts said. ""I plan to stay in Provo a while after I graduate so I can work for start-up companies, allowing me to check on the app's progress on a daily basis. My dream is that someday this app will become self-sustaining.""

Winners and losers of globalization
Although it's said that ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" globalization has not benefitted everyone equally. Over the past forty years, some groups have seen their incomes rapidly rise, whereas others have only seen stagnation. I will describe below the winners and losers of globalization.
*elephant chart
	After China's reform and opening up in 1979, foreign companies invested massive resources into the country, bringing opportunity and growth. A similar growth occurred in India. Between these two countries, a huge part of the world's population was lifted out of poverty. Having gained access to clean water and healthcare, life expectancy and quality of life rose. This group, known as the ""global middle class"" is one of the undisputed winners of globalization. 
	On the other side of the spectrum, the global elite, known as ""plutocrats"" have also profited from the surge in globalization. The CEOs and managers of finance and tech companies have outsourced labor to cheaper offshore workers, and as a result, have widened their profit margins substantially. Technology has allowed these companies to access billions of global customers in every market. High-level workers at these companies have been rewarded handsomely for their efforts.
	Although the upper class in developed countries has risen to the top, the lower and middle classes in the same countries have stagnated. In countries such as the United States, Japan, and Germany, where manufacturing once reigned supreme, workers have been left jobless, without a promotion or advancement in 40 years. These unfortunate people constitute the ""losers"" of globalization. Their jobs have been outsourced to developing nations, while the upper class rises higher and higher.
	Globalization has been a boon for the global middle class and the global elite, while it has left the middle class of developed nations in the dust. Time will tell if this trend will continue or somehow reverse.

Gender Equality Gap

In 2022, men and women continue to be treated differently at work. The most striking areas of concern are the gender pay gap, gender distribution imbalances, and sexual harassment. Everyone agrees that harassment is unacceptable, but not everyone agrees on the source of the gender pay gap or gender distribution imbalances within various industries like STEM. Some countries, like Sweden, have sought to close the pay gap by equalizing gender distribution in the workplace. Official government policies seek to give companies in typically male-dominated industries benefits for hiring women, and impose penalties for hiring men. This, among other policies, constitutes part of Sweden's mission to be the world's ""most feminist government.""
	Experts believed that these gender equality policies would lead to a rise in female participation in STEM. However, researchers were shocked to find the exact opposite phenomenon. Since implementing these policies, female participation in STEM has actually dropped! This is known as the gender equality paradox. In the years following this research, experts have attempted to explain the reason for the unexpected result. Some experts suspect that the root cause may be biological, whereas others suspect that cultural factors are at play.
	Sweden's high quality of life affords people the freedom to choose their career free from economic concerns. Someone who is willing to work in a typically low-paying field is free to follow their heart. The government provides free education, healthcare, and many social benefits. Income is no longer a primary concern for Swedish young people. If this is the case, then men and women are free to pursue their natural talents and passions. It's possible that the reduction in female participation in STEM represents the freedom of women to pursue a different field they prefer even more.
	On the other hand, we must account for the centuries-long exclusion of women from STEM in Europe. This gender stereotype has persisted until today, and according to many, is even intensifying. In contrast, other countries like Algeria, Turkey, and Iran, see high female participation in STEM, possibly because no such gender stereotypes have prevented women from entering STEM in the past. Some of the world's greatest female mathematicians and scientists have come from countries with little gender equality.

Content types and MT

Although the content explosion requires more translation than ever, the current pool of translators and interpreters simply can't meet the huge demand. Companies are now considering the use of MT for certain types of content. Which types of content are suitable for MT and which are not? I will explain below.
	MT is not appropriate for high-value, high-visibility, high-creativity content. The front page of your website deserves the touch of a human expert. The translated PowerPoint presentation your boss will give on a foreign business trip, should be thoroughly reviewed by a senior linguist. Subtitles for a film or video require the creative intuition of an experienced translator.
	But what about the instructions for a medical device? Certainly MT is not appropriate for such a mission-critical document. You may be surprised to find out that MT is a great choice for this kind of content, as long as a qualified human post-editor reviews the raw MT output. What makes this kind of content appropriate for MT? Technical writing tends to use short sentences, clear terminology, simple sentence structure, and unambiguous language. All these factors result in a machine translation output that is remarkably accurate.
Although MT makes mistakes from time-to-time, consider that human translators aren't perfect either! Mistakes made by humans may be harder to spot, whereas mistakes made by MT can be easily identified and fixed.
Finally, there are some types of content which are suitable for MT with no human post-editing required. Patent lawyers use MT to get the gist of a document. Foodies and travelers use MT to read online reviews posted in other languages. EBay uses MT to make product listings available to anyone around the globe. Some product documentation or ""instructions for use"" are produced with MT. The bottom line is this: if you can understand the basic meaning, it's good enough.

Bike safety is a big topic. Wear a helmet. Follow traffic laws, like halting at stop signs. Don't go too fast, and make sure your brakes work.
This is all useful advice. It has been beat over my head since elementary school. Nonetheless, it didn't help me from getting into bike accidents during college. To tackle that problem, I took advice that depended on game theory and the concept of focal points.
Focal Points
Imagine you and a partner are in an experiment. Each of you will be shown a diagram of four boxes and asked to pick one. You will not be allowed to communicate with your partner.
If you manage to pick the same box as your partner, then you both get $10. If not, then both of you go home empty-handed.
Suppose you are playing the game. What box would you pick?
/
It turns out that the strategy is tremendously simple: for each box your partner picks, you will simply match the pick. The hard part is figuring out what your partner will guess since you cannot communicate with each other.
As you can see, this game has a sense of ""team spirit."" Both players would like to pick corresponding strategies for mutual gain. We play these types of games often�an example that comes to mind is how friends coordinate outfits, so no two people end up wearing the same thing. Appropriately, such games go by the name of coordination games.
There is no box that's ""better"" than another one. The payoff is simply dependent on picking the same one. If you and your partner are good friends, you might have common knowledge about each other to help you win. You might pick box four, for example, because you know it is your friend's favorite number.
But what if you and your partner were complete strangers? How might you arrive at the same box?
As the problem is stated, there is no particular box that is better to pick. Both of you would go about picking numbers randomly and just accept the 25% random chance of winning (4 winning pairs out of a possible 16).
But now let's say the experiment was slightly changed. Imagine instead of being faced with four identical boxes, you and your partner were shown a diagram like this:
/
Now, which box would you choose?
As you can see, box two is specially marked in red. You might realize that it stands out, and suspect that it would also stand out to your partner, the complete stranger. And that's the trick.
The special marking makes both players pick box two ""naturally."" It's a form of organizing and communicating without actually being able to talk. Remember, there is nothing special about picking box two. The other equilibriums are the players both picking any of the other boxes. What makes box two special is the marking and attraction to it as a choice.
Such an equilibrium earns the fitting name of focal point. It is also known by the name Schelling point, in honor of the game theorist Thomas Schelling, who introduced the concept in his 1960 book The Strategy of Conflict.
It is worth noting that focal points are dependent on social beliefs. In America, I would think most experiment participants would pick box two because it stood out.
But I can imagine this is not necessarily true cross-culturally. It is possible in another culture that it's considered bad luck to pick the prominent square. Under that system, the natural choice would be never pick box two.
This is helpful knowledge. Eliminating one choice raises the chances of success from 25 percent to just over 33 percent.
The Bike Game
Avoiding bike crashes is type of coordination game. Bikers want to coordinate to avoid occupying the same real estate at the same time.
Let's start with a simplified version of the game with two bikers moving in opposing directions:
/
 
To simplify matters, we can say that each biker has a choice of going straight, moving to his left, or moving to his right.
Crashes occur when both bikers go straight, or when they both swerve to the same path�either left or right.
/
The remaining combinations, say one goes straight and other swerves right, will result in a safe exchange. There are six ""safe"" cases compared to the three ""crash"" cases.
Thanks to the nature of the game, by random chance, it's twice as likely that the bikers will avoid each other than crash.
Furthermore, there is a focal point that can reduce crashes. We Americans drive on the right hand side of the road, so it is natural that both bikers would swerve to their respective right side.
This rule of thumb helps avoid crashes. Plus, it doubles as a good tip for walking in hallways of American offices.
/
Unfortunately, our friendly human nature tends to undermine the safe focal point. What many of us do is get nervous and try to make eye contact with the other biker.
When you make eye contact, you feel the need to mirror what the other person is doing. Because you have limited time to respond, you don't react fast enough. You even ruin the random chance of a safe passage and make crash the likely course.
And that' why the best advice I ever got about bike safety was this rule: avoid eye contact with an oncoming biker. It's not mind-blowing advice, nor does it always seem nice, but it is very practical. When you don't stare at the other person, you both will rely on the focal point of swerving to the right.
(My friends and I joked that the ""no stare"" advice is virtually impossible to follow when the oncoming biker is attractive. But then the game is different, as you probably wouldn't mind bumping into that person and starting up a conversation).
Some Students Make the Game More Difficult
As I mentioned earlier, focal points are dependent on culture. While avoiding eye contact gets to the ""swerve right"" equilibrium for Americans, it fails for many international students who drive on the left side of the road, and have the instinct to ""swerve left.""
Then, there is another twist. Some students aren't playing the game of coordination. They view the interaction more like a game of chicken. These people will never swerve because they don't want to slow down and often they enjoy the opportunity to yell at others.
The game is also more complicated since there are more variables. The realistic situation involves four-war intersections with high traffic. Now each biker has to coordinate with more than one other biker, and there are more bikers on the road. Even if natural bike safety reduced the crash rate to one percent, an intersection with 1,000 such games played per day would have about 10 crashes. In my opinion, that is just not good enough.
What can be done?
Well think back to the box problem. An experimenter who wanted to see success could nudge participants in the right direction by highlighting a box and essentially manufacturing a focal point. The conclusion is the bike game can be improved with better design.
To get fewer crashes, the design can be changed to create a focal point.
Here's one implementation: create a bike circle with one way traffic, and have arrows to indicate the direction:
/
If enough bikers follow the rules, then traffic will flow in one-way. Enforcement should come about naturally. New bikers will also follow the traffic as that will be the safest route.
The bike circle creates its own inefficiency, say, if one's goal is to simply turn left. But it overall should reduce risk and crashes, which are far more costly.
It's an interesting enough idea that Stanford is trying it out.
I bet one reason they are trying a bicycle roundabout is because new bikers can figure out the one-way flow of traffic very quickly. This is crucial on a campus with thousands of new students coming in every year.
The lesson: if you are running an event, and want to coordinate many people, consider the design and the idea of focal points to help the operation run smoothly.

"﻿Do you trust the product recommendations made by influencers?
Influencers have become artificial identification screeners for a huge number of products, recommending various goods to their followers with the guarantee of personal reputation and word-of-mouth. However, due to the uneven moral quality of influencers and the negligence of the relevant institutions, various problems lurk behind the influencers' merchandising. For example, product quality and safety are not guaranteed, product publicity does not match the real picture, and data on the platform such as likes and retweets are falsified.

Everyone has a different way of screening the products recommended by influencers. I would trust influencers who have more followers and a better reputation, especially if they are honest about the pros and cons of the product during the introduction. After watching the video, first, browse the comments under the video, then go to the software to check the ingredients of the product, and choose the product that really suits you, before you go to the e-commerce platform to search and buy.

Despite the chaos of influencer marketing, with greater consumer discernment and stricter platform regulation, we are still able to buy quality goods.

In this film, many characters fit the archetypes in the hero's journey template that make the film a pass. However, I think it is the vividness of characterization that took Best Picture of Oscar home. 
The film tells a story of a mother, the heroine, Evelyn Wang, who saves the multiverse. She is a Chinese-American mother exhausted in running a laundry and paying endless tax in her original world, her own universe. Her husband Waymond Wang in the universe is a cowardly person in her view. 
Evelyn is called to adventure by her husband Alpha Wang in another universe. Alpha Wang teaches her how to use skills and get energy from herself in other universes through an uncertainty hilarious action and tells her that she is the one who will save the world. Apparently, Alpha Wang is her mentor. 
The shadow is Evelyn's daughter Joy. What makes Joy distinguishable is that she doesn't need to switch skills through an action. She is in every universe simultaneously, which means there is only one Joy in all universes. Although she is invincible, she is suffering being in the void. She wants to lead Evelyn to the void called ""Bingo"" to feel what she feels, and subsequently the multiverse will break into nothingness. 
Finally, Evelyn stops Joy and saves the multiverse.

Give five tips to someone who wants to become an influencer.
Several tips:
Find your niche on social media. Start small by becoming a micro-influencer. Each influencer has their own characteristics. Someone might prefer to dress up. Another might be great at making videos. Find your own niche.
Keep innovating with new content. You have to keep up with the changes in society. Don't fall behind, or else your viewers will lose interest and your reach will diminish.
Use a variety of marketing tactics to reach your target audience. The audience is the most important thing for an influencer. Pay attention to the preferences of your audience and adjust your content accordingly.
What you say and what you do matters. Your actions should match your speech. Don't be a hypocrite. Your behavior sets an example for your fans.
Be careful, you may be the target of cyberbullying.
Create your own company to help you do some extra work, like video creation and content creation.

What forms do memes take and how are they transmitted?
Memes can take various forms: images, phrases, videos, or even abstract ideas. They can be transmitted through spoken communication, written text, social media, television, the internet, or radio. All these methods of communication allow the meme to travel abroad and reach a wide range of people.
Some information, like DNA, is spread vertically, from generation to generation. The rate of vertical spread is much slower than the horizontal spread of memes, which can span the globe in an instant.
Memes can be spread both vertically and horizontally. The vertical spread of memes actually means the evolution of memes. As a meme is spread, it can generate some new ideas and combine with other ideas.
Memes can spread very quickly ""horizontally"" on the internet throughout the globe in an instant.

Please choose any movie, book, TV show, or story, and explain how it fits into the hero's journey.

I will describe the plot of Lord of the Rings. The hero, Frodo, once lived peacefully in Hobbiton. He gets the one ring from his uncle, Bilbo. This is Frodo's call to adventure. One day, Gandalf comes to visit, and tells him the danger of the one ring. Gandalf wants Frodo to destroy the one ring by tossing it in the fiery depths of Mount Doom.
This is meeting the mentor. Frodo refuses Gandalf because he just wants to live in Hobbiton. That's the refusal of the call.
Eventually, he accepts. On his way, he meets many friends and allies such as Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. He also encounters enemies such as the ringwraiths: evil spirits tempted by the ring. Gollum and Saruman are also in pursuit of Frodo. Gollum is a withered, crazed, decrepit hobbit driven mad by his lust for the ring. Frodo has many allies and enemies.
Frodo encounters many difficulties, failures, and deadly temptations from the one ring. But he manages to climb Mt. Doom and throw the ring into the fire.
On the road back, He returns to Hobbiton to rebuild his community. As a reward for his sacrifice, he is granted his ultimate reward: passage across the sea to live eternally with the elves.

"﻿Q: How does excessive individualism causse the Avengers' downfall in Avengers: Infinity War? What is the Avengers' solution in Avengers: Endgame?
The Avengers is a well-known Marvel sci-fi film series that is beloved by people around the world. The core of American culture and values, individualism, is on full display in the films.
In Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos is willing to sacrifice half the population to achieve the prosperity of a society with scarce resources but numerous people. Superheroes gather to fight Thanos. Yet excessive individualism compels them to decide to save their friends, even at the expense of the lives of many others. They are only concerned with their friends at the moment, disregarding how serious the consequences of such decisions would be for all humanity. The Avengers are doomed to fail. The decisions they make show the ultimate extremity of the worship of the individual. When people become so protective of individuality, they are willing to sacrifice anything to save the individual, even if it means sacrificing everyone else.
Nevertheless, the Avengers choose an entirely different approach to the dilemma, sacrificing themselves for the lives of their friends rather than sacrificing half of the universe. In Avengers' Endgame, these superheroes lay down their lives to protect humanity as well as their friends. Their individualism is weakened, and they also end up defeating Thanos. That's what makes them heroes. Through the series, individualism is not entirely harmful, but sometimes used in an appropriate way to create wonders.

"﻿How do Western and Eastern approaches to education differ?
    Eastern and Western approaches to education differ significantly in several aspects. 
    In Eastern countries, public schools are the dominant option, and education is compulsory. However, in Western countries, there are diverse options, including public, private, and homeschooling. Western education allows for more flexibility in choosing educational pathways.
    Another difference lies in the classroom structure. In Eastern education, students are often segregated by their academic ability and tend to stick with their own class of 20-30 students. On the other hand, Western education promotes a mixed collection of students in each class, allowing for greater interaction among peers. Western students have the opportunity to regularly interact with other students.
    The curriculum emphasis also varies. Eastern education tends to place more focus on subjects like English and mathematics, emphasizing academic performance. In contrast, Western education provides more extracurricular opportunities, such as sports teams, music bands, choir, etc., allowing students to explore their interests beyond academics.
    The educational environment itself also differs. Eastern education tends to create a more academic-focused atmosphere, with limited room for social activities. Dating is banned during the school years. In contrast, Western education promotes a more social environment, with activities, dances, parties, clubs, and church groups being considered normal. Dating is generally accepted and allowed in high school.
    Additionally, the daily schedule of schools differs between the two approaches. In Eastern countries, students go home late in the evening, and they spend most of the time in studying. Outside of studying, they might engage in activities like surfing the internet, playing games, or hanging out with friends. In Western countries, schools typically end around 3 pm, giving students more free time. They may participate in sports, outdoor activities, video games, movies, social media, or spend time with friends. They also have the option to join clubs or attend church activities.

"﻿What is inflation? Is it all bad or is a little bit ok? How does the Cantillon Effect work?

    In the first two decades of the 21st century, our cost of living has risen. There may come a day when you suddenly realize that the price level is incomparable to that of 20 years ago, and this is the impact of inflation on our lives. Inflation is constantly occurring as the purchasing power of the national currency continues to decrease. The causes of inflation can be summarized as follows: firstly, inflation occurs when the growth rate is too fast due to the increase in money issuance by the central bank; secondly, people's demand increases, which may be due to a general rise in purchasing power or population growth; thirdly, inflation also occurs when the country's currency depreciates, leading to higher import prices; fourthly, rising production costs also contribute to price growth. I believe moderate inflation is acceptable. To my knowledge, China's annual inflation rate is about 3%. Although it is a modest number, it also means that the cash you keep at home will depreciate at the same rate. Only by allowing our money to flow can we avoid inflation eroding our wealth.

    When the money supply increases, the individuals or organizations that first come into contact with the new money are able to benefit from its increase. However, as money gradually circulates in the economy, price increases gradually occur, resulting in losses for those who come into contact with the currency at a later stage. This redistribution of wealth is caused by the increase in prices resulting from the increase in money, leading to the early acquirers of money benefiting in terms of purchasing power, while those who acquire money later experience a loss in purchasing power. This is known as the Cantillon effect. It reveals an economic phenomenon where the Cantillon effect generally has a negative impact on the masses who are the last to come into ""contact"" with the released money.

"﻿What value does a university education provide?
Most students viewed going to college as just a necessary part of life without exploring the value it provides for us. In fact, the value obtained from a university education may benefit us for a lifetime. The value of university education can be seen from different perspectives. 

First, on average, individuals with a university degree tend to earn more over their lifetime than those without one. That is partly because a university education can provide you with a network of fellows who can help you advance your career. During your studies at university, you will also meet experts and professors in the field and may gain access to various academic resources and opportunities. And for your personal growth, a university education can enrich your subject knowledge, as well as develop your critical thinking, research and communication skills by exposing you to diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences. 

Exploring the value of a university education is also the joy of entering a university. But a university education is just one of the pathways to success. Not having a college education does not mean that you are completely deprived of opportunity. Other forms of education or training can also lead to meaningful personal growth.

"﻿Why might someone be interested in homeschooling? Are those reasons different between China and the United States?

There are various reasons why someone might be interested in homeschooling their children. One common reason is the desire to have more control over the educational environment. In traditional schools, there can be a mix of students with different backgrounds and behaviors, which some parents may find concerning. Homeschooling allows parents to create a more tailored and focused learning environment for their children, with fewer distractions.

The reasons for homeschooling may differ between China and the United States. In the United States, the educational system often involves students moving to different classrooms for various subjects, resulting in interaction with a wide range of classmates throughout the day. This can lead to concern about exposure to different influences. In contrast, in China, classrooms generally consist of a smaller group of students who stay together for the entire year or longer. This cohesive environment may provide a sense of stability and familiarity.

Furthermore, homeschooling may face more challenges and social acceptance in China compared to the United States. Homeschooling is still relatively uncommon in China, and the mainstream culture tends to value traditional schooling. This cultural difference might contribute to the perception that homeschooling is less acceptable in China compared to the United States, where it is more widely practiced and accepted as an alternative form of education.

"﻿What are the aims of the Fed and what tools does it use to create new money?
Leftie 202213609041

The Federal Reserve, commonly referred to as ""The Fed,"" is the central banking system of the United States. The aims of the fed includes maximizing employment, stabilizing prices to prevent inflation and deflation, and moderating long-term interest rates. In order to achieve these goals, the Fed uses three main tools: open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements.

Open market operations is how the Fed creates new money to purchase financial assets, which is known as quantitative easing and increases the money supply. While the discount rate is the short-term borrowing rate between banks that all other interest rates are based on. The lower the rate, the easier and more cost-effective it is to borrow money, leading to growth in the money supply. Finally, reserve requirements are the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold. Lowering the minimum bar means more money is released by the bank, so the money supply also grows. 

Overall, the Fed aims at maintaining a stable and growing economy by controlling the supply of money. By using these tools, the Fed can help stimulate economic growth and prevent economic crisis.

"﻿There is ongoing debate in the fields of economics and robotics as to whether or not automation will put humans out of a job in the long term. While automation has the potential to displace some human workers, it can also create new jobs and industries.

However, it's possible that automation could lead to job displacement and unemployment in the short-term, particularly in industries that are most vulnerable to automation. In this scenario, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) could serve as a safety net for individuals who have lost their jobs due to automation.

A UBI could provide individuals with a basic level of income to cover their basic needs, such as food and shelter, while they seek out new job opportunities or participate in retraining programs. By supporting individuals who have lost their jobs to automation, a UBI program could potentially ease the societal and economic disruptions that could result from rapid technological change.

In addition, a UBI could promote entrepreneurship and innovation, as it would provide individuals with the financial security to take risks and pursue their own ventures. This could potentially lead to job creation and new industries.

Overall, while it's uncertain whether automation will eventually put humans out of a job, a UBI could serve as an effective policy tool to promote economic stability and well-being if job displacement does occur.

"﻿What caused the demonetization of rai stones and aggry beads?

Rai stones and aggry beads are two different forms of currency that were used in different regions throughout history. 
In Micronesian Island of Yap, rai stones were highly valued due to their unforgeable nature. These massive stones required significant manpower to transport from other islands. Transactions and ownership of them were recorded through oral means. However, the weight of rai stones made their transportation arduous, and the transaction process was prone to errors. Additionally, with the arrival of the colonizers, rai stones gradually fell out of use and were eventually demonetized.
Compared to rai stones, the aggry beads were smaller and more portable. Glass aggry beads were used as currency in West Africa as early as the 15th century. Since glassmaking technology was scarce and expensive in Africa, aggry beads were well-suited to serve as a medium of exchange in the local area. However, with the advancement of glassmaking technology in European countries, colonizers took advantage of the situation. They exploited the resources, labor, and people of West Africa by manufacturing fake beads at low cost. As a result, the rarity of aggry beads diminished, leading to a decrease in their value. Consequently, people became more inclined to use the high-value currencies of the colonizers, such as the British pound or the US dollar.

"﻿What is the significance of August 15th, 1971?

On August 15th, President of the United States Richard Nixon announced his New Economic Policy, a program that ""closed the gold window."" Known as the ""Nixon Shock"", the incident marked the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods system.

Under the Bretton Woods System, the values of foreign currencies were fixed in relation to the U.S. dollar. However, when the United States experienced domestic inflation after World War II and didn't have enough gold to cover the volume of dollars in worldwide circulation, the dollar was overvalued. Then, traders in foreign markets turned to believe that the dollar's overvaluation would one day force the U.S. government to devalue it. As a result, they decided to sell their U.S. dollars and exchange them for gold as a store of value. 

On the evening of August 15, President Nixon announced his New Economic Policy in an address to the nation on ""The Challenge of Peace."" To face the challenges of a post-Vietnam world and ""protect the dollar from the attacks of international money speculators"", Nixon directed the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold. This proposal meant the end of the Bretton Woods system established after World War II, and also became the catalyst for the stagflation of the 1970s in the whole world.

"﻿From the elephant chart, we can draw a conclusion: the global middle class are the winners of globalization, while the working class in rich nations are the losers.
The world economy didn't experience significant growth until the late 1700s to early 1800s. It was relatively flat. Nonetheless, there was a sudden surge in the quality of life of people in Western Europe and North America. Then it changes in globalization 2.0, which brings us to something called the elephant chart. Created by economist Branko Milanovic, the chart provides valuable insights into global inequality and the winners and losers since the late 1980s.
The chart resembles an elephant shape with three dramatic points. The first point is at the top of the elephant's head, marked as point A. This represents the global middle class, mostly in Asia, such as India or China. These people have electricity, refrigeration, and better incomes. They live longer and better. The second point is the lowest point, identified as point B. This represents the working class in rich countries. Although they still make a fair amount of money compared to the rest of the world, their incomes have not improved. Consequently, they're the relative losers of the last generation. The expanding opportunities for cheaper Asian labor contribute to the relative income decrease for those in point B.

"﻿Is there such thing as a ""free lunch?"" Are your favorite mobile apps really free?

Is there such a thing as a ""free lunch""? Absolutely not. Consider those ""free lunches"" you have encountered before, are they truly free? In reality, just like many apps or shopping malls, the free offerings are merely a tactic employed by companies or founders to gain benefits. They entice you with these free items, only to prompt you to purchase other products or incur additional costs.
For instance, in real life, my preferred take-out apps like Meituan and Ele.me provide consumers with monthly coupons that can be used to offset the cost of ordering take-out. However, there is a condition attached to using these coupons ---- you must meet a certain spending threshold. The ""free lunch"" also exits in certain supermarkets like Sam's Club, where you can sample various free foods and even receive complimentary eyesight and hearing tests. Yet, it is not easy to partake in these free offerings. To enjoy the free foods and tests, you must first become a Sam's Club member by paying around 200 yuan, which grants you access to the store, the opportunity to sample the foods, and the ability to shop for other items.

The tentpole film production ""My People, My Country"" provides grand and ambitious scale narratives spanning seven decades of the People's Republic of China to capture historical moments, but through the unique perspectives of ordinary people.
The film, set to dominate China's 70th National Day holiday season, is a combination of seven short films by seven elite Chinese directors headed by award-winning veterans Chen Kaige and Huang Jianxin. 
The film's focus is not about the historical moments themselves, but is through an ordinary people's perspective to portray those who were dedicated to or affected by the historical moments. 
""We were very worried, because seven directors for one movie, this never happened before,"" film director Huang Jianxin said at the premiere held in Beijing on Saturday. He served as producer of the project. 
""There were few successful precedents in world film history. But two weeks ago, after the general director Chen Kaige and I finished watching the rough cut of the film, we both cried at the end and shook hands in excitement. Each episode in 'My People, My Country' reflected what touched the directors deep in their hearts and will surely resonate with all the audience.""
""My People, My Country"" consists of seven parts: The first, directed by Guan Hu, is about how the engineer Lin Zhiyuan ensured the technical details were secured to electronically hoist the very first Chinese nation flag at the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949. 
The second, directed by Zhang Yibai, is about how a scientist working on China's first atom bomb had to bid farewell forever to his lover in the 1960s. The third, directed by Xu Zheng, is about how a little Shanghai boy helped local adults to watch TV for the Chinese women volleyball team's Olympic gold medal win in 1984.
The fourth, directed by Xue Xiaolu, is about ordinary Hong Kong people, a Chinese executive delegation as well as local policemen prepared for the return of city from British rule to China in 1997. The fifth, directed by Ning Hao, is about how a taxi driver shows off the ticket he has luckily obtained for the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but then encounters a boy from Sichuan earthquake zone and makes a big decision. 
The sixth, directed by Wen Muye, is about how a top female fighter jet pilot helps her fellow pilots accomplish a smooth aerial performance, part of the military parade to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War in 2015.
The seventh, directed by Chen Kaige, is a story related to the manned spacecraft Shenzhou-11's astronauts' return to Earth, landing in Inner Mongolia in 2016. Chen, who oversaw all the directors' works and also directed his own part, stated his unique creative vision at the premiere: ""Our country has a vast territory, but development is actually unbalanced. Our focus should not only be on the developed areas in the eastern coastal areas, but also on those areas that are temporarily left behind.""
He added, ""If a person encounters a historical opportunity to be changed, the inspiring power generated is unbelievable. In my story, the landing of Shenzhou-11 changed the lives of two teenagers, changed their destiny and allowed them to gain new hope.""
The film not only attracted all-star directors, but also a star-studded cast including Huang Bo, Ge You, Simon Yam, Kara Wai, Zhou Dongyu, Ren Suxi, Peng Yuchang, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Tong Liya, Zhang Yi, Wang Qianyuan, Song Jia and more. All said they are honored to have been part of this project.

""My People, My Country"" will also revive the fond memories and get closer to the heartstrings of Hong Kong people, as indicated by tearful statements by two Hong Kong veteran actors. 
""When I was young, I was begging food from foreigners in Hong Kong's red-light district, I had so many bitter and tough experiences in the past, and I always asked where I should belong,"" Hong Kong actress Kara Wai said, emotionally, ""So, I kept waiting for answers for years, until the day when Hong Kong returned to China after it was lost for 154 years. On that day, I could say it loudly that I'm Chinese, I have a country at last. I'm so proud to tell everyone.""
Simon Yam, who recovered from a horrific stabbing incident by a mentally ill man in July, attended the premiere. He echoed Wai's sentiment, saying: ""On the day of Hong Kong's return, I felt it wasn't just a return to the motherland, but the return of hearts. When the flag was raised, I felt like, 'We are home, we feel secured and assured.'""
""My People, My Country"" is sweeping the Chinese film market, having presold more than 200 million yuan-worth of tickets so far before its opening on Sept. 30.
Its Chinese title, ""Me and My Motherland"", is borrowed from a household tender Chinese patriotic classic song originally performed by singer Li Guyi in 1985. The song was reworked by pop diva Faye Wong and its release triggered national discussions on social media.

MITTechnologyReview
https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/27/1087041/technological-unemployment-elon-musk-jobs-ai/
In a 1938 article, MIT's president argued that technical progress didn't mean fewer jobs. He's still right.
By David Rotman
MIT Technology Review is celebrating our 125th anniversary with an online series that draws lessons for the future from our past coverage of technology. 
It was 1938, and the pain of the Great Depression was still very real. Unemployment in the US was around 20%. Everyone was worried about jobs.
In 1930, the prominent British economist John Maynard Keynes had warned that we were ""being afflicted with a new disease"" called technological unemployment. Labor-saving advances, he wrote, were ""outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour."" There seemed to be examples everywhere. New machinery was transforming factories and farms. Mechanical switching being adopted by the nation's telephone network was wiping out the need for local phone operators, one of the most common jobs for young American women in the early 20th century.
Were the impressive technological achievements that were making life easier for many also destroying jobs and wreaking havoc on the economy? To make sense of it all, Karl T. Compton, the president of MIT from 1930 to 1948 and one of the leading scientists of the day, wrote in the December 1938 issue of this publication about the ""Bogey of Technological Unemployment.""
How, began Compton, should we think about the debate over technological unemployment�""the loss of work due to obsolescence of an industry or use of machines to replace workmen or increase their per capita production""? He then posed this question: ""Are machines the genii which spring from Aladdin's Lamp of Science to supply every need and desire of man, or are they Frankenstein monsters which will destroy man who created them?"" Compton signaled that he'd take a more grounded view: ""I shall only try to summarize the situation as I see it.""  
His essay concisely framed the debate over jobs and technical progress in a way that remains relevant, especially given today's fears over the impact of artificial intelligence. Impressive recent breakthroughs in generative AI, smart robots, and driverless cars are again leading many to worry that advanced technologies will replace human workers and decrease the overall demand for labor. Some leading Silicon Valley techno-optimists even postulate that we're headed toward a jobless future where everything can be done by AI. 
While today's technologies certainly look very different from those of the 1930s, Compton's article is a worthwhile reminder that worries over the future of jobs are not new and are best addressed by applying an understanding of economics, rather than conjuring up genies and monsters.
Uneven impacts
Compton drew a sharp distinction between the consequences of technological progress on ""industry as a whole"" and the effects, often painful, on individuals. 
For ""industry as a whole,"" he concluded, ""technological unemployment is a myth."" That's because, he argued, technology ""has created so many new industries"" and has expanded the market for many items by ""lowering the cost of production to make a price within reach of large masses of purchasers."" In short, technological advances had created more jobs overall. The argument�and the question of whether it is still true�remains pertinent in the age of AI.
Then Compton abruptly switched perspectives, acknowledging that for some workers and communities, ""technological unemployment may be a very serious social problem, as in a town whose mill has had to shut down, or in a craft which has been superseded by a new art.""
Even those who agreed that jobs will come back in ""the long run"" were concerned that ""displaced wage-earners must eat and care for their families 'in the short run.'""
This analysis reconciled the reality all around�millions without jobs�with the promise of progress and the benefits of innovation. Compton, a physicist, was the first chair of a scientific advisory board formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he began his 1938 essay with a quote from the board's 1935 report to the president: ""That our national health, prosperity and pleasure largely depend upon science for their maintenance and their future improvement, no informed person would deny."" 
Compton's assertion that technical progress had produced a net gain in employment wasn't without controversy. According to a New York Times article written in 1940 by Louis Stark, a leading labor journalist, Compton ""clashed"" with Roosevelt after the president told Congress, ""We have not yet found a way to employ the surplus of our labor which the efficiency of our industrial processes has created.""
As Stark explained, the issue was whether ""technological progress, by increasing the efficiency of our industrial processes, take[s] jobs away faster than it creates them."" Stark reported recently gathered data on the strong productivity gains from new machines and production processes in various sectors, including the cigar, rubber, and textile industries. In theory, as Compton argued, that meant more goods at a lower price, and�again in theory�more demand for these cheaper products, leading to more jobs. But as Stark explained, the worry was: How quickly would the increased productivity lead to those lower prices and greater demand?  
As Stark put it, even those who agreed that jobs will come back in ""the long run"" were concerned that ""displaced wage-earners must eat and care for their families 'in the short run.'""
World War II soon meant there was no shortage of employment opportunities. But the job worries continued. In fact, while it has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the health of the economy, anxiety over technological unemployment has never gone away. 
Automation and AI
Lessons for our current AI era can be drawn not just from the 1930s but also from the early 1960s. Unemployment was high. Some leading thinkers of the time claimed that automation and rapid productivity growth would outpace the demand for labor. In 1962, MIT Technology Review sought to debunk the panic with an essay by Robert Solow, an MIT economist who received the 1987 Nobel Prize for explaining the role of technology in economic growth and who died late last year at the age of 99. 
In his piece, titled ""Problems That Don't Worry Me,"" Solow scoffed at the idea that automation was leading to mass unemployment. Productivity growth between 1947 and 1960, he noted, had been around 3% a year. ""That's nothing to be sneezed at, but neither does it amount to a revolution,"" he wrote. No great productivity boom meant there was no evidence of a second Industrial Revolution that ""threatens catastrophic unemployment."" But, like Compton, Solow also acknowledged a different type of problem with the rapid technological changes: ""certain specific kinds of labor � may become obsolete and command a suddenly lower price in the market � and the human cost can be very great.""
These days, the panic is over artificial intelligence and other advanced digital technologies. Like the 1930s and the early 1960s, the early 2010s were a time of high unemployment, in this case because the economy was struggling to recover from the 2007�'09 financial crisis. It was also a time of impressive new technologies. Smartphones were suddenly everywhere. Social media was taking off. There were glimpses of driverless cars and breakthroughs in AI. Could those advances be related to the lackluster demand for labor? Could they portend a jobless future?
Again, the debate played out in the pages of MIT Technology Review. In a story I wrote titled ""How Technology Is Destroying Jobs,"" economist Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleague Andrew McAfee argued that technological change was eliminating jobs faster than it was creating them. This wasn't just about a mill shutting down. Rather, advanced digital technologies were leading to job losses across a broad swath of the economy, raising the specter once again of technological unemployment.
Like the 1930s and the early 1960s, the early 2010s were a time of high unemployment.
It's difficult to pinpoint a single cause for something as complex as a dip in total employment�it could be just a result of sluggish economic growth. But it was becoming increasingly obvious, both in the data and in everyday observations, that new technologies were changing the types of jobs in demand�and while that was nothing new, the scope of the transition was troubling, and so was the speed at which it was happening. Industrial robots had killed off many well-paying manufacturing jobs in places like the Rust Belt, and now AI and other digital technologies were coming after clerical and office jobs�and even, it was feared, truck driving.
In his farewell speech before leaving office in January 2017, President Barack Obama spoke about ""the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle-class jobs obsolete."" By that time, it was clear that Compton's optimism needed to be rethought. Technical progress was not turning out to lead to inevitable job growth, and the pain was not limited to a few specific locations and industries.
Why Musk is wrong
In an interview late last year with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Elon Musk declared there will come a time when ""no job is needed,"" thanks to an AI ""magic genie that can do everything you want."" Musk added that as a result, ""we won't have universal basic income, we'll have universal high income""�apparently answering Compton's rhetorical question about whether machines will be ""the genii which � supply every need and desire of man."" 
It might not be possible to prove Musk wrong, since he gave no timeline for his utopian prediction; in any case, how do you argue against the power of a magical genie? But the end-of-work meme is a distraction as we figure out the best way to use AI to expand the economy and create new jobs.
Breakthroughs in generative AI, such as ChatGPT and other large language models, will likely transform the economy and labor markets. But there's no convincing evidence that we're on a path to a jobless future. To paraphrase Solow, we should worry about that when there's a problem to worry about.
Even a bullish estimate about the effects of generative AI by Goldman Sachs puts its impact on productivity growth at around 1.5% a year over the next 10 years. That, as Solow might say, is nothing to sneeze at, but it's not going to end the need for workers. The Goldman Sachs report calculated that roughly two-thirds of US jobs are ""exposed to some degree of automation by AI."" Yet this conclusion is often misinterpreted�it doesn't mean all those jobs will be replaced. Rather, as the Goldman Sachs report notes, most of these positions are ""only partially exposed to automation."" For many of these workers, AI will become part of the workday and won't necessarily lead to layoffs.
The end-of-work meme is a distraction as we figure out the best way to use AI to expand the economy and create new jobs.
One critical wild card is how many new jobs will be created by AI even as existing ones disappear. Estimating such job creation is notoriously difficult. But MIT's David Autor and his collaborators recently calculated that 60% of employment in 2018 was in types of jobs that didn't exist before 1940. One reason innovation has created so many new jobs is that it has increased the productivity of workers, augmenting their capabilities and expanding their potential to do new tasks. The bad news: this job creation is countered by the labor-destroying impact of automation when it's used to simply replace workers. As Autor and his coauthors conclude, one of the key questions now is whether ""automation is accelerating relative to augmentation, as many researchers and policymakers fear.""
In recent decades, companies have often used AI and advanced automation to slash jobs and cut costs. There's no economic rule that innovation will in fact favor augmentation and job creation over this type of automation. But we have a choice going forward: we can use technology to simply replace workers, or we can use it to expand their skills and capabilities, leading to economic growth and new jobs.
One of the lasting strengths of Compton's 1938 essay was his argument that companies needed to take responsibility for limiting the pain of any technological transition. His suggestions included ""co�peration between industries of a community to synchronize layoffs in one company with new employment in another."" That might sound outdated in today's global economy. But the underlying sentiment remains relevant: ""The fundamental criterion for good management in this matter, as in every other, is that the predominant motive must not be quick profits but best ultimate service of the public.""
At a time when AI companies are gaining unprecedented power and wealth, they also need to take greater responsibility for how the technology is affecting workers. Conjuring up a magical genie to explain an inevitable jobless future doesn't cut it. We can choose how AI will define the future of work.

"﻿Evolving Desires, Enduring Jobs
Ideas by Nick Lambson, writing by AI
The discourse surrounding automation and artificial intelligence often pivots around a central anxiety: the potential displacement of human labor. This fear, while grounded in the observable progression of technological efficiency, misses a crucial philosophical insight � that the evolution of work is intrinsically tied to humanity's struggle against nature's entropic forces and our relentless pursuit of survival and flourishing.
At the heart of this philosophical examination lies the concept of entropy, a term borrowed from thermodynamics, which describes the inherent tendency of natural systems to degrade into disorder. Human civilization, in its unyielding quest for stability and progress, has harnessed technology and automation as bulwarks against this natural decay. From rudimentary tools to sophisticated AI systems, our innovations serve as mechanisms to secure resources, enhance productivity, and ultimately, ensure the continuation and enrichment of human life.
The narrative of technological unemployment, therefore, must be situated within a broader context of evolving human values and aspirations. Work, initially centered around the necessities for survival such as food production and shelter construction, has progressively transformed into more nuanced and diverse forms as technology alleviates the burden of basic sustenance. This shift mirrors Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where once the foundational requirements of physiological and safety needs are met, individuals can aspire towards self-actualization through creative, intellectual, and social endeavors.
The concern that automation may render jobs obsolete overlooks the dynamic nature of human desires and the adaptability of economies. As history attests, from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, each wave of technological disruption has led not to widespread idleness but to the creation of new industries and forms of employment. The notion of 'value-driven action,' as posited, underscores this transition; as survival becomes less arduous, work evolves to embody higher-order values such as aesthetics, innovation, and personal fulfillment.
This philosophical stance aligns with the post-work theories, which posit that advancements in technology could potentially liberate humans from compulsory labor, allowing society to redefine the meaning and purpose of work. However, it also intersects with critiques of capitalism, highlighting the unequal distribution of productive assets. In this view, the fear of job loss stems from a systemic issue where the majority, lacking ownership of the means of production, are dependent on employment for survival. This echoes Marxist critiques, where the bourgeoisie's control over capital perpetuates a cycle of exploitation and alienation among the proletariat.
Yet, the analogy to the Renaissance period, where patronage by the affluent facilitated artistic and cultural revolutions, offers a nuanced perspective. It suggests that under a scenario of reduced labor demand, those who control substantial productive assets could potentially drive a new era of sponsored creativity and intellectual pursuits, akin to the Medici family's role in fostering the Italian Renaissance. Here, the future of work is reimagined as less about conventional jobs and more about aligning individual talents with the values and desires of asset owners, thereby sustaining a cycle of mutual benefit and societal enrichment.
In conclusion, the philosophical inquiry into automation's impact on jobs transcends a simplistic dichotomy of job loss versus retention. Instead, it prompts a deeper reflection on the essence of human progress, the evolution of labor in response to technological advancements, and the need for a societal recalibration that ensures equitable access to the fruits of automation. By recognizing the potential for a post-scarcity society, where human creativity and value-driven pursuits are prioritized, we can begin to construct a vision of the future that transcends traditional employment models and embraces a more holistic understanding of human flourishing.

It was also a time of impressive new technologies. Smartphones were suddenly everywhere. Social media was taking off. There were glimpses of driverless cars and breakthroughs in AI. Could those advances be related to the lackluster demand for labor? Could they portend a jobless future?
Again, the debate played out in the pages of MIT Technology Review. In a story I wrote titled ""How Technology Is Destroying Jobs,"" economist Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleague Andrew McAfee argued that technological change was eliminating jobs faster than it was creating them. This wasn't just about a mill shutting down. Rather, advanced digital technologies were leading to job losses across a broad swath of the economy, raising the specter once again of technological unemployment.
Like the 1930s and the early 1960s, the early 2010s were a time of high unemployment.
It's difficult to pinpoint a single cause for something as complex as a dip in total employment�it could be just a result of sluggish economic growth. But it was becoming increasingly obvious, both in the data and in everyday observations, that new technologies were changing the types of jobs in demand�and while that was nothing new, the scope of the transition was troubling, and so was the speed at which it was happening. Industrial robots had killed off many well-paying manufacturing jobs in places like the Rust Belt, and now AI and other digital technologies were coming after clerical and office jobs�and even, it was feared, truck driving.
In his farewell speech before leaving office in January 2017, President Barack Obama spoke about ""the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle-class jobs obsolete."" By that time, it was clear that Compton's optimism needed to be rethought. Technical progress was not turning out to lead to inevitable job growth, and the pain was not limited to a few specific locations and industries.
Why Musk is wrong
In an interview late last year with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Elon Musk declared there will come a time when ""no job is needed,"" thanks to an AI ""magic genie that can do everything you want."" Musk added that as a result, ""we won't have universal basic income, we'll have universal high income""�apparently answering Compton's rhetorical question about whether machines will be ""the genii which � supply every need and desire of man."" 
It might not be possible to prove Musk wrong, since he gave no timeline for his utopian prediction; in any case, how do you argue against the power of a magical genie? But the end-of-work meme is a distraction as we figure out the best way to use AI to expand the economy and create new jobs.
Breakthroughs in generative AI, such as ChatGPT and other large language models, will likely transform the economy and labor markets. But there's no convincing evidence that we're on a path to a jobless future. To paraphrase Solow, we should worry about that when there's a problem to worry about.
Even a bullish estimate about the effects of generative AI by Goldman Sachs puts its impact on productivity growth at around 1.5% a year over the next 10 years. That, as Solow might say, is nothing to sneeze at, but it's not going to end the need for workers. The Goldman Sachs report calculated that roughly two-thirds of US jobs are ""exposed to some degree of automation by AI."" Yet this conclusion is often misinterpreted�it doesn't mean all those jobs will be replaced. Rather, as the Goldman Sachs report notes, most of these positions are ""only partially exposed to automation."" For many of these workers, AI will become part of the workday and won't necessarily lead to layoffs.
The end-of-work meme is a distraction as we figure out the best way to use AI to expand the economy and create new jobs.
One critical wild card is how many new jobs will be created by AI even as existing ones disappear. Estimating such job creation is notoriously difficult. But MIT's David Autor and his collaborators recently calculated that 60% of employment in 2018 was in types of jobs that didn't exist before 1940. One reason innovation has created so many new jobs is that it has increased the productivity of workers, augmenting their capabilities and expanding their potential to do new tasks. The bad news: this job creation is countered by the labor-destroying impact of automation when it's used to simply replace workers. As Autor and his coauthors conclude, one of the key questions now is whether ""automation is accelerating relative to augmentation, as many researchers and policymakers fear.""
In recent decades, companies have often used AI and advanced automation to slash jobs and cut costs. There's no economic rule that innovation will in fact favor augmentation and job creation over this type of automation. But we have a choice going forward: we can use technology to simply replace workers, or we can use it to expand their skills and capabilities, leading to economic growth and new jobs.
One of the lasting strengths of Compton's 1938 essay was his argument that companies needed to take responsibility for limiting the pain of any technological transition. His suggestions included ""co�peration between industries of a community to synchronize layoffs in one company with new employment in another."" That might sound outdated in today's global economy. But the underlying sentiment remains relevant: ""The fundamental criterion for good management in this matter, as in every other, is that the predominant motive must not be quick profits but best ultimate service of the public.""
At a time when AI companies are gaining unprecedented power and wealth, they also need to take greater responsibility for how the technology is affecting workers. Conjuring up a magical genie to explain an inevitable jobless future doesn't cut it. We can choose how AI will define the future of work.

CONCLUSION
Introduction
The sheer volume of information the eyes take in at any moment is incomprehensible. Look around and take note of everything that you see. If outside, notice the trees, cars, people, and everything in between. If sitting at a desk, take note of the pens, paper, notebook, and all the other material in front of you. 
The mind processes these things so fast you're not even aware of the processing happen. You simply move your eyes in a direction, and they instantaneously detect and understand all that you see. 
When we read, however, things are not quite as smooth and fluid. It takes time and effort to process words, and the meaning conveyed by those words. For many, reading is a demanding activity that consumes substantial mental energy. For some, it proves so strenuous they avoid reading altogether. 
So, the question is why can't we process text in the same way we process other shapes and objects in our environment? 
The truth is we can! 
The human eye is an incredible organ. It is the second most complex organ in the body, containing 2 million components and 12 million photoreceptors. It functions faster and has a wider dynamic range than any camera. Brain scientists and information experts assert that up to 90 percent of the information we take in comes through the eyes.
The eyes do not operate alone but work in conjunction with the brain. In fact, the eyes are directly connected to the brain, which leads many to suggest that the eyes are an extension of the brain rather than distinct, separate organs. Scientists estimate that as much as 65 percent of the brain is used to process visual information.
If the eyes are the second most complex organ in the body, that makes the brain the most complex. Not only is the brain the most complex organ, but the human brain is considered the most complex structure in the known universe. It is more complex than planets, stars, and even airplanes. The brain is behind our every thought, action, memory, feeling, and experience in the world.
So, humans are walking around with two of the world's most complex systems working together to provide the basic foundation of intelligence through observing, thinking, writing, and above all, reading. We have the natural ability to read and process information at a high level.
Unfortunately, most of us are simply not using this ability. That's because reading isn't something that originated in or exists in nature. Reading is something that humans created, and since it is manmade, it is not an instinctual skill that we are born to do. It is a skill that must be learned.
Most of us learn to read, but that doesn't mean we learn to read the most effective way possible. Our educational systems and teachers, along with parents, do an admirable job of teaching us how to combine words to form sentences. However, they don't necessarily teach us the best ways to use our impressive eyes and mind to do that. As a result, we are left feeling like we are not capable of reading better or faster.
This couldn't be further from the truth. The reality is, we are all capable of reading better and faster than we ever imagined. We simply need to learn the correct ways to use our infinitely powerful eyes and mind.
That is what this book aims to teach. With simple strategies that unleash the power of the mind and sight, the techniques in this book fill in the gaps teachers failed to cover to accelerate reading in ways you can't imagine.
If you seek that level of improvement, continue reading.

The Process
Since the eyes and mind already have the ability to process visual information at a high level, this book doesn't require you to learn or do anything new or difficult. All it requires is to make slight shifts in reading habits.
As a result, this book is not terribly long or complicated. Each chapter is just a few pages and is very easy to read and understand. The chapters provide exactly what is needed to improve reading speed�and nothing more. The truth is, many of the important shifts in reading habits take only a few minutes to learn.
You can literally double or even triple current reading speed within minutes of reading some of the chapters and increase speed even further after practicing and applying the additional suggestions. With commitment, there is no doubt that you will develop the ability to read a 200+ page book in one hour!
Also, reading and comprehension go hand-in-hand, so in addition to improving reading speed, you will learn to improve comprehension. After all, the purpose of reading faster is to learn more information. What good is reading quickly if we can't make sense of and retain that information? Improving speed without improving comprehension is not speed reading. The aim is to help you read faster and with greater comprehension.
What's Inside
This book is divided into 5 sections. Each section has 3 chapters, and each chapter covers 1 aspect of the speed reading process.
Section I discusses what to do before beginning to read. Most people assume reading is only about picking up a book and reading words. That's an ineffective approach. There are important steps that precede the reading process, and the chapters in this section discuss these steps and explain why they are important.
Section II presents techniques that focus directly on increasing the ability to read more words in less time. That is, reading significantly more words in a significantly shorter amount of time. The techniques in this section are what people seek to improve reading. It is the heart of the speed reading process and where those small shifts in habits that bring about the big results lie.
Section III expands on the techniques presented in Section II. It offers guidance on how to both enhance and refine the suggested techniques, all toward pushing reading speed even further. Committing to the process will push your ability to practically inhale information from written material.
Section IV is all about comprehension. Remember, reading without comprehension is not reading. This section teaches effective strategies to better understand how authors write and organize written material and ways to use that knowledge to better understand their message. The material in this section also addresses creative ways to enhance vocabulary, a key element for both reading and comprehension.
Section V addresses topics that don't fit anywhere else. Although each chapter in this section stands on its own, each contains important lessons to enhance the reading experience, including improving memory, overcoming daydreaming, and maintaining eye health. This final section is extremely important and ties everything together.
This all may seem like a lot to take in, but trust me, it is manageable. Remember, each chapter is only a few pages long, and the majority of the advice is easy to read and to understand. After understanding what to do, it is then simply a matter of devoting the time and effort to practice.
This brings up the next point:
Old Habits Die Hard
Although the lessons do not present significant learning challenges, where challenges may arise is in shifting reading habits. Habits are routines or behaviors that are repeated so often and for so long that they become automatic�and then permanent. Habits engage without conscious choice or decision, and often, they become the default action or response. Any behavior can become a habit, and that includes poor reading.
Habits are difficult to break�extremely difficult. Even when a behavior isn't working and a better way exists, habits will keep you in a rut. Even if the alternative is the simplest technique, explained using the clearest instructions ever written, the persistent habit will make the new technique difficult to apply. Despite knowing what to do, and how to do it, old habits make it challenging to actually do it.
Such is the nature of habits. They are designed to keep you in a routine, regardless of the benefit or pain they bring. Therefore, something as simple as shifting eye gaze may at first feel like pulling teeth, creating resistance, discomfort, or even pain.
In order to effectively apply the instructions in this book, it is important to break free from old habits and adopt new ones. A great way to adopt new habits is with practice drills. Drills involve repeating a routine over and over, not in conjunction with any other activity, until the body develops a rhythm and habit for it.
Drills are key to successful skill development. High performers in many disciplines become high performers by regularly practicing their craft with drills. Practice drills are essential to learning, retaining, and most importantly, easing into doing something new.
For this reason, the chapters in this book end with practice drills, which present simple exercises that help you integrate and get accustomed to the instructions. I strongly recommend taking these drills seriously by performing each one before moving to the next chapter.
The mind and body learn and remember better from doing than from reading, hearing, or seeing. The sooner you start applying the techniques, the sooner you'll see improvements in reading. That means not only will these drills motivate you to begin using the techniques, but they will maximize learning.
Also, many of the drills build upon one another. For example, the drill in one chapter instructs practicing one technique, while the drill in the next chapter instructs practicing another technique in combination with the first. In a subsequent chapter, you'll then practice the three techniques together.
This cumulative approach trains you to use these techniques simultaneously. This way you can learn, understand, and physically integrate all the lessons by the time you finish the book. After finishing, you can jump to speed reading other material instead of starting at square one.
The drills presented in this book are simple and brief, each requiring 5 to 20 minutes to complete. Working through them will make a huge impact on your ability to learn and integrate the information. If you skip the drills, you will experience difficulty with the techniques and ultimately not form the habits to use them.
People falsely assume they can take what they read and automatically apply it. That's wishful thinking. In order to apply the techniques, you need to apply the techniques, and these drills help you do that. With that said, don't skip any of the drills. They are the most important part of this book.
Majority of the drills involve practicing the techniques on a wide range of materials. So, before reading further, gather as many different types of written content as possible�everything from stories, novels, narratives, and articles to textbooks, manuals, newspapers, biographies, and trade journals to a variety of magazines, such as fashion, business, and special interest. Keep these materials at arm's length while reading this book, so when you arrive at a drill, you can start right away.
It might help to go to a library or book store, since all this material will be in close proximity. If that's not possible, work with what is available in the immediate environment.
With all the formalities out of the way, let's begin developing the skill to read a 200+ page book in 1 hour.
Section I � Pre-Reading
Chapter 1 � Purpose
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why�Mark Twain.
As noted in the introduction, reading isn't about jumping into a book the moment you pick it up. There are steps that precede the reading process that aid one's ability to absorb a text. The three chapters in this section each discuss one of these pre-reading steps, starting with purpose.
Have you ever noticed that when you're in the market for a new car and have settled on a particular model, you suddenly begin seeing that model everywhere? Or when setting a goal, opportunities related to that goal and ways to achieve it begin appearing all over?
This happens because the mind is a goal seeking, purpose driven machine. Having a goal or purpose activates different neural networks and regions of the brain to work in unison. So, each region of the brain is not just doing its own thing. With purpose, the focus of the mind changes and its awareness opens, often without you realizing.
This is why new opportunities begin appearing. Of course, those same opportunities existed prior to setting the goal, but since they were of no interest at the time, the mind paid them no attention.
In addition to assisting one to achieve goals, numerous well-documented studies show that purpose offers a host of physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Purpose in a person's life reduces the risk and the effects of many illnesses, including heart attack, stroke, Alzheimer's, depression, addiction, suicide, and anxiety.
Purpose improves mental function, increases concentration, and actually repairs the DNA. When people have purpose, they live longer, are happier, and have an easier time handling challenges, finding solutions, managing conflicts, using resources, and most importantly, living with a sense of belonging and well-being.
Purpose has power!
Purpose is incredibly valuable to reading as well. When a goal or purpose is applied to a reading assignment, suddenly the mind stops wandering, and instead, becomes focused on the material at hand. This shift helps the reader become more attentive and less distracted, so he or she can get through a passage in less time and with less effort.
Since purpose has such an influence on the mind, the next time you sit down to read, set a goal or establish a purpose. Determine beforehand what you want or hope to gain from the material.
Interestingly, we all have a purpose when reading. Anytime we pick up a book, magazine, or article, it's for a reason. The reason might be to ace an exam, write a paper, or to complete an assignment. Maybe it's to find an answer, learn a skill, or solve a problem. Some read to end boredom or to unwind and get lost in a fantasy. Whatever the purpose, there is a purpose�even if you don't consciously recognize that purpose.
Now, just because you know the purpose, that doesn't mean the mind will know as well. We often assume that we are one with our minds. We believe that when we know what we want, our minds automatically know as well. Sadly, that isn't true.
In any given moment, we have hundreds or even thousands of wants, drives, and desires percolating inside. Our minds are sifting through all of these wants to figure out which one to pursue. Should I message a friend, respond to the boss, watch a show, eat lunch, clean up, ask out a classmate, listen to music, or play outside?
Clarifying your purpose helps the mind tremendously. Instead of evaluating which of the hundred urges to follow, it has a clear directive. It knows what to tune out and where to turn its attention. In other words, if you want your mind to know and pursue your goals and intentions, you must identify and clearly state them.
Anytime you pick up something to read, state the purpose or intention for reading it. The clearer the purpose, the easier it will be for the mind to interpret the information�and the faster you can sift through it.
Your purpose does not have to be long, drawn-out, or complicated. It can be as simple as I'm reviewing yesterday's notes to find answers for tomorrow's assignment. That's it.
The key is to determine why you are reading the text or what you want to know once finished. If reading for an assignment, you might ask why the instructor assigned the chapter or section. Two universal questions include: What can I get out of this material or How will this reading impact me?
Another option is to ask yourself precise questions that you'd like the material to answer. This option is easier with manuals and guide books, but can be applied to other materials as well.
The following are suggestions for different purposes you can set for a variety of materials:
� I am reading this book to learn money-saving strategies that will help me grow my business.
� I am studying chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the history textbook to ace next week's mid-terms.
� My goal for reading this manual is to improve my computer programming skills for the new project at work.
� I am reading this novel to prepare for tomorrow's literature discussion.
� I am reviewing this book to gain the knowledge I need to write an engaging research paper deserving of an A.
� The purpose of reading for the next few hours is to unwind, relax, and get lost in the author's tale.
� I am researching the internet to find a better treatment option for my illness.
These examples illustrate how to define and state purpose. When you can't think of any on your own, feel free to borrow one from this list. Use it as is or modify it to fit the current situation or need.
Sometimes, it's annoying to step back and set a purpose, and it may seem cumbersome to do so every time you sit down to read. I'm sure you would rather just get started, because the sooner you can start, the sooner you will finish.
Sure, developing a purpose takes time but very little time. It shouldn't take longer than a few seconds to one minute to state a clear, meaningful objective. The short time that is spent will, in turn, help you get more from the reading, which will, ultimately, save considerably more time in the long run.
Practice Drill
For this drill, take out a blank sheet of paper.
1. Write down all the types of material you have read in the past. Note anything and everything, whether it was a sports magazine, internet article, Twitter post, history book, or science report. Don't limit the material to what was read in the recent past�go as far back as possible.
After writing down everything you can remember, next to each item, record your reason for reading that piece. Think about the reasons this chapter described earlier. Whatever they are, note them down.
2. Next, compile a list of all the reading you have planned in the next week, whether for school, work, or leisure. Next to these items, again cite the purpose.
3. Repeat step 2 for everything you expect to read in the next month. For students, this should be straightforward since most teachers and professors provide a course syllabus with the required reading outlined. If you are not a student, it helps to think about books you intend to buy, courses you plan to attend, topics you hope to learn, skills you seek to develop, or job assignments you expect to receive.
Once again, think about the motivation for reading each of these items. What do you hope to get out of the material? Even if it is painstakingly obvious, write it down.
Make sure to be detailed and descriptive. Don't simply write, the purpose for reading the report is to not get fired. A better alternative might be: to understand the client's logistic requirements to streamline their delivery. Write in such a way that would allow someone who doesn't know you to clearly understand the motivation.
4. Repeat step 2 one more time for materials you are likely to come across in the next year.
Completing the 4 steps will provide you with a list of purposes for just about any material you encounter in the future. When reaching for something to read, you won't have to deal with the frustration of thinking about the objective. Instead, you can simply reference what emerged in this drill, and either modify it or use it as is. This will not only save time, but also the headache that comes with trying to identify a clear purpose.
Purpose is valuable because it helps us determine what we want to get out of reading. Once we know, we can inspect the text to see if it will meet our goal. If it does not, a great deal of time has been saved right off the bat. So, what is a good way to inspect a written piece to see if it meets a given purpose? We discuss this in the next chapter.
Chapter 2 � Power of Preview
Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions�Albert Einstein
Several years ago, while traveling in Belize, I met a fellow traveler, a Canadian woman who had a particular habit. Whenever she arrived in a new city or town, the first thing she did was take a few hours to walk around and explore. She had to do that; otherwise, she would get anxious and restless.
We ended up traveling together, so whenever we arrived in a new town, we dropped our bags at the hotel and explored the town or neighborhood. It was an interesting experience. Taking on her practice made me feel as if I had done something worthwhile, because it gave me a useful preview of the town. I gained a better understanding of what to do, where to go, how to get there, and what the locals were like.
Since then, I've made her habit my own. The first thing I do in a new place is walk around and explore for a few hours. This really sets my expectations of what there is to do, and how much time I need or want to spend in that place.
This is how I want you to approach reading. I want you to preview material before reading it. That means scrolling through the text, scanning the table of contents, major headings, any words in bold or italics, visual aids, and any information that seems important.
Preview is one of the most important steps readers can take to improve reading speed and comprehension. That's because previewing gives the mind a framework of what will be discussed. This helps the mind understand the type of information that will be presented and how it will be organized.
It may not seem like a big deal to you, but to the mind, it's huge. It's like giving it the box cover of a jigsaw puzzle. Assembling a puzzle without the cover is time consuming and difficult. With the cover, you can see the big picture, so it's easier to figure out where the pieces go and how they fit.
The same principal applies to previewing what you read. It helps the mind see all the pieces and understand how they come together. As a result, you can quickly make sense of the material.
More importantly, previewing helps the mind make more accurate predictions about what is being read. Let's examine why this is important. Scientists constantly rave about how the human brain is so complex and powerful that we are decades away from building a computer that can do everything the brain can do. Even the introduction of this book touts the amazing power of the brain.
If the brain is so complex and powerful, why does it, and hence, why do we make mistakes? Humans are by no means perfect. Countless quotes speak of our erroneous nature, such as To err is human.
One reason is that the mind doesn't necessarily respond to what is happening in real time but to what it thinks is going to happen. In other words, the mind is continually making predictions about the future.
Have you ever been in conversation and sensed what the other person was about to say before he or she said it? Have you watched a movie or read a story and somehow knew how it would end? Or perhaps you've had a feeling, hunch, or intuition about something that later came true?
These experiences occur because the mind is perpetually preparing for the unexpected�such as a predator jumping out at you. If you can react to a dangerous event before it happens, you are likely to survive it. At the same time, if you can anticipate an opportunity before the competition, you can take advantage of it. So, it is extremely useful to make snap judgments about the environment and to act on those judgments.
In order to do that, the mind makes predictions from a series of clues. It acts and reacts based on those predictions rather than on reality. In other words, we respond to people not based on what they are saying but on what we assume they are going to say. We react to situations not based on the outcome but rather on our fear and anticipation of the outcome. And we respond not based on the actual question someone asks but on the question the mind believes is being asked. When our predictions are wrong, mistakes occur.
This happens in reading as well. As we read, our minds constantly predict what will come next. Whether or not we are aware of these predictions, they are there, occurring in the background. This means that we interpret what we read not always based on the actual text but often on what our mind predicts the text is going to say�sometimes based on what the mind wants the text to say.
This is why proofreaders are taught to spell check by reading backward. When reading forward, the mind can guess, based on the context of the sentence or paragraph, the word that should come next. Therefore, we see words as they should be, not as they are. As a result, we increase the likelihood of overlooking spelling and grammatical errors. Since it's impossible to make sense of a sentence or paragraph when reading backward, the practice ensures that the mind sees text as it exists on the page.
The benefit of predicting what comes next is that you can read faster. There's no need to dissect every word, sentence, and paragraph with a fine-tooth comb to acquire meaning. Based on the author, topic, writing style, content, and other clues, your mental processes can simultaneously read and comprehend.
This is where preview is valuable. Preview helps the mind make accurate predictions. It allows the mind to see what the text is about, determine its length, and assess the writing style. And in the background, it can begin thinking about the material and the possible directions it can go.
While reading, the mind will reference what it learned from preview to confirm that its predictions reflect the actual content. This not only translates into faster reading but better comprehension.
Skilled readers almost never read a text cold. Instead, they examine it first with preview. This allows them to begin reading with a great deal of information already processed. As a result, their mind is not guessing or worrying about what comes next. It can relax and concentrate on what is being read.
So, whether you're about to read an article, report, manual, novel, or chapter from a textbook, preview it before reading. You will experience a greater level of comprehension and may even increase speed.
Preview Guidelines
It is important to note that different materials require different approaches to preview. Books and manuals tend to be involved, so they demand extra time at this stage. Articles and reports, on the other hand, are usually shorter and more straightforward, so they do not require as much time or effort. In a previous book, I summarized preview guidelines that readers found useful, so I've included them here.
Articles and Reports
Read the first and last paragraphs, examine words in bold or italics, read any quoted texts, and glance at any illustrations.
Books and Manuals
Read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents to get a feel for organization, and notice if the book is divided into sections or parts. Read chapter headings to get a sense of the topics that will be covered.
Next, read samples of the text. If there is a preface, begin sampling the reading there. Read also the full introduction and conclusion. Finally, skim through the book and take note of items in bold, italics, quotes, and any diagrams or tables. While skimming, read the first and last paragraphs of each chapter.
Textbooks
The approach to previewing textbooks is similar to books and manuals, though in all likelihood, you'll be reading a textbook for a class. This means that the reading will be assigned one chapter at a time�or even one subheading at a time. So instead of previewing the entire textbook, focus only on the portion that has been assigned.
Begin by reviewing the chapter objectives, then read the summaries at the start of each chapter. Most textbooks have review questions at the end of each chapter or section; read these and keep them in mind. As always, examine any and all items in bold, italics, and quotes, as well as all illustrations and graphs.
Stories & Novels
Students always ask whether it is necessary to preview stories or novels. The answer is that it depends on one's purpose. If reading a story or novel for pleasure, it's likely a person would want to avoid any sort of preview; otherwise, he or she may discover too much of the plot, or worse, uncover the ending. This takes away from the joy of reading such material.
On the other hand, if reading a story or novel as an assignment for class, especially if your knowledge and understanding will be tested, then it's beneficial to preview. In these instances, approach preview like any other material: read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents. Skim through the text. This type of material is unlikely to have items in bold or italics, or many illustrations or graphs, so instead, pay attention to the plot, setting, characters, and the roles they play.
These are some guidelines on how to approach preview with different types of material. In addition to these guidelines, it might help to identify sections or topics to which the author devotes the most amount of time and space as they are likely to have high value. The topics that use visual aids are also likely to be important. You might also analyze the type of writing�academic or general audience�and even the difficulty of the text. Allow the mind to absorb as much information about the material as possible.
To remember all this, use the acronym T.H.I.E.V.E.S:
� Title
� Headings
� Introduction
� Every word in bold, underline, quote, and italics
� Visuals Aids
� End of Chapter Questions
� Summary/Conclusion
Since preview is only a preparation step, do not spend too much time at this stage. The goal of preview is to sample the material, not get caught up in details.
Therefore, spend no more than 45 seconds to 5 minutes on this step. Typically, this means 45 seconds to 1 minute for shorter items like articles and reports, and 3 to 5 minutes for lengthier ones, such as books and manuals.
As with stating a purpose, you may feel that preview goes against the goal of speed reading. That is, the time spent on preview is time that could be used for reading, so valuable time is wasted previewing material you plan to read anyway. As a result, you may make excuses, like This is a short article, in the time it takes to preview, I can be done with it.
It's important to understand that the mind is going to make predictions about the text, whether you preview it or not. You can't stop this process. It is hardwired into the brain. By skipping preview, the mind is likely to make inaccurate predictions, making it difficult to understand the material.
Those who experience difficulty reading do so simply because the material is saying something different from what their mind is expecting it to say. The mind is expecting the subject to go in one direction; when in reality, it's going somewhere completely different. This disconnect causes a gap in understanding. The wider the gap between the prediction and actual content, the tougher it is to read and comprehend.
As defined in the intro, speed reading isn't about how fast one moves through text but how fast the facts and ideas can be comprehended. So yes, it is possible to speed through text without preview, but comprehension will suffer. The time saved comes at a cost, so it's just best to preview.
Another point to address is that at times, preview may not always help you gain a stronger grasp of the material. In some cases, preview may actually leave you confused. And that's to be expected.
Realize that preview is not necessarily meant for you but rather for your mind. Any given material on any given topic can go in a million directions. An article about galaxies, for example, can discuss an assortment of facts since so much has been discovered about the topic. Preview helps the mind zero in on all the options. The mind may not guess exactly what's going to be discussed, but through preview, it can eliminate a million different possibilities. Eliminating possibilities is essential for accurate predictions.
Finally, preview can help determine if the text will meet the goal or purpose you established in Chapter 1. Based on the info gathered from preview, determine if the material will contain the information or answers you seek. If you determine from preview that the material will not meet your purpose, then you've saved a great deal of time. If the material has the potential to meet the underlying purpose, you can proceed with confidence.
If after preview, you are still unsure whether the material will meet the purpose, you might delve deeper into the preview process or begin reading with a little caution. If time is limited, skip the sections to which the least amount of space is devoted or where redundant information exists. Of course, also skip what you already know and read only the new information that you need.
Preview Drill
The introduction asked you to collect various types of reading materials, such as articles, novels, reports, and books. If you haven't already, please gather them now as they will be required for this and subsequent drills.
Practice previewing each type of material you pulled together. Don't read through any of it yet; just focus on the preview step. Pick an article. Then, read the title and author, the first and last paragraphs, scan through the body for words in bold, italics, underline, and any illustrations, such as graphs, charts, and diagrams. Briefly consider what you might learn from the article and the overall message the author is trying to convey.
After previewing the article, choose something different, such as a book. Books are lengthier, so start with the summary and blurb on the back cover. From there, review the table of contents, paying careful attention to the chapter titles and subheadings. Next, read the first and last chapters, and finally, scan through the content for important information, or anything else that catches the eye.
Continue doing this with the rest of the materials. Preview one. When you are done, preview the next. After completing that one, preview another after that. Habituate yourself to go straight to preview anytime you pick up something to read.
Anytime you have the urge to start without preview, practice resisting that urge. No matter how quickly the mind wants to get started, refrain yourself. If necessary, put the book down until the urge subsides. Condition your brain and habits to understand that it's not okay to proceed without preview. Let them know not to push you into reading without previewing it first.
Preview is important, but equally important is the manner in which you choose to read material. All content is not created equal when it comes to how you read it, and that's what we'll discuss next.
Chapter 3 � Change Styles
Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested�Francis Bacon
When it comes to reading, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Not all material is meant to be read the same way. Not all material can be read the same way. Some materials are challenging, while others prove much easier to read.
In addition, your initial understanding of a subject plays a significant role in how quickly it can be read. If the subject is new or unfamiliar, no matter how well written it is, you will need to reduce reading speed to grasp it fully. If the subject is familiar, you likely won't even notice that what you're reading is difficult.
It is, therefore, wise to adjust reading speed in accordance with the importance, form, genre, and difficulty of the material. In other words, you don't want to approach reading a textbook in the same way as an email. And you don't want to approach email in the same way as a training manual. Each type of material presents its own challenges. It's important to be aware of these challenges and adjust reading speed accordingly.
You are probably thinking, Well, this is obvious.
Indeed, it is very obvious!
As obvious as it is, people continue to read all types of material, across all genres, as if all of those materials were exactly the same.
The primary reason people do this is habit. People become accustomed to reading a certain way, especially if they are often reading the same kind of material, such as a novel or textbook. Once people fall into a pattern, they tend to apply that pattern to all material.
The action is not conscious�it just happens. As soon as we pick up a book, habit takes over, and we're in the habituated pattern. If our pattern of reading isn't the best fit for the material at hand, we have a hard time taking in or making sense of it. This causes us to assume that we are not cut out for the subject, topic, or information.
Challenge this assumption!
Perhaps you simply need to adjust the reading process. That means changing the speed at which the material is read, as well as the level of energy and attention put forth while reading.
Don't assume that all written works must be read in the same manner or at the same speed. Also, don't feel bad that certain types of material or subjects require you to read slower than others. It's in no way a reflection of your intelligence. It is okay to vary reading approach based on the material.
Here are detailed guidelines about how to approach different types of reading material to arrive at the best possible outcome.
Let's start with technical manuals, which often present detailed instructions and procedures that must be carefully followed. This makes each line of text extremely important. Overlooking one or two sentences may result in errors that can have grave consequences. Therefore, curb the temptation to haphazardly skim over this kind of work. Instead, carefully chew and digest each and every line of text.
The same approach applies to legal documents, annual reports, write-ups, and policies. These types of documents are better read in their entirety and given full attention and focus. Similarly, it's sensible to slow down if you have to teach the material to someone else. Even a love letter or poem might be worth slowing down for, so you can enjoy the prose in the way the writer intended.
When reading material related to your academic major or profession, there's less need to be as careful. Nonetheless, remain careful enough to fully understand and retain the material. This can include taking notes and stopping regularly to test your knowledge of the subject. The same applies if the text is complicated, filled with big words and fancy grammar, or if you are new to the subject.
On the other hand, if you are well versed in a topic, are already familiar with the writer's other work, or are accustomed to the genre, you can increase pace. Some people are used to reading textbooks; whether computer science or political science, they have no problem learning from such material. For others, textbooks are stale and boring, so they have to really change their pace and rhythm to stay engaged.
With material read for pleasure, you can be relaxed. There is no need to rush, but at the same time, there is no need to go slow. Read at a pace that feels comfortable and enjoyable in the moment.
This will vary depending on your mood. Some days, you'll feel like reading without worrying about what you learn, how much you take in, or how useful it will prove. Other days, you may find that absorbing every sensory detail or dissecting the meaning behind every word is more enjoyable.
At the same time, no need to force yourself to read each and every sentence; take in what you can and skip areas that offer little or no interest. Some delight in a leisurely perusal of the morning paper by selecting areas of interest while ignoring content that lacks appeal. If it's for pleasure, do what is pleasing.
Something else worth considering is how long the information will remain relevant. If reading to find a solution to a problem, but once solved, you have no further use for the information, then there is no need to be so meticulous. On the other hand, if the information is essential to your major or occupation, or if it's indispensable in another area of life, such as health or finances, be thorough.
Also take into account the level of knowledge you seek. Do you seek quick explanation, broad ideas, complete comprehension, or detailed analysis? It goes without saying that the more detailed and complete awareness you seek, the slower and more attentively you should read.
Finally, always spend extra time on information that sets the foundation for complex or elaborate ideas. The natural inclination is to skim over such foundational content, because it tends to feel familiar or easy to grasp. However, if you skim over the basics, you will have difficulty reading and learning what comes later. Certain subjects are, indeed, cumulative!
This means pay extra attention to earlier parts of books, stories, and novels, as that's where the foundational elements are developed. Once you have a solid base, you can change pace as desired.
Some content requires switching pace frequently. Certain chapters or sections you'll read quickly. Other chapters, you'll hit a patch that is difficult or that you sense is important, so you slow down and read carefully. Then, you speed up again.
This applies particularly to research. Research requires reading a wide range of related materials to support or reject a claim, or to find a solution. When conducting research, many ideas will be familiar. In fact, ideas that appear in one source may also appear in several other sources. In these cases, race over the ideas that repeat and slow down for topics that are new or foreign.
With that said, speed reading isn't always about hitting cruise control or flooring the gas to reach maximum velocity. Sometimes, the road will backup, you'll hit a series of lights, or find yourself stuck in heavy traffic. Other times, you'll be in such a rhythm, it'll feel like you're on the open highway.
In summary, anytime you pick up a book or other reading material, don't just start reading it using your standard pattern. Take a moment to gauge the content and your purpose. Ask yourself the following questions:
� What am I trying to gain from the material�background information on a topic I know little about or specific details and facts to support an argument?
� How long will the information be relevant�for the moment, to clear a temporary hurdle, or for the foreseeable future of my profession?
� How difficult is the material to read and comprehend?
Based on your answers, adjust reading accordingly.
This is the reason the first two chapters on preview and purpose are so important, because they provide these insights. Carefully taking the prescribed steps outlined in Chapters 1 and 2 will immediately reveal the adjustments that need to be made to your reading.
Practice Drill
Take the materials you were asked to collect�all the different reports, articles, and books�and read a few pages of each. Based on what you gathered from the preview step about the style, form, genre, and relevance, adjust your reading pace and rhythm.
If the text is challenging, read slowly. The same applies if the topic is new, unfamiliar, or if it is something you really want or need to remember. On the other hand, if the content proves boring, familiar, or easy to read, process, and digest, feel free to increase speed.
When doing this drill, alternate between excerpts that are easy and ones that are difficult. After sampling an easy one, read a difficult one. Then, return to an easy one. Alternating the difficulty like this gives you practice adjusting speed and rhythm.
Like most people, you will find it difficult to switch pace. Your habit wants to read all material at the one speed to which it has become accustomed, and going against the habit will create resistance.
And, if you are the type of person who is always on the go, you want to get through the material as quickly as possible, regardless of purpose or difficulty. You have no desire to slow down or adjust pace. Your only desire is to keep going and going. In fact, it may almost be impossible for you to slow down. Even knowing concepts are being missed, the old habits keep pushing you forward.
Resist these tendencies. Work to shift reading pace to suit the style and difficulty of the material. Slow down if necessary, even if the resistance is great. If your natural inclination is to read slow, speed up to a pace that's slightly uncomfortable. Practice getting accustomed to reading at different speeds.
This concludes Section I on prereading�important steps that precede the reading process. In this section, you learned three activities one should do before beginning any reading task: define purpose, preview, and change reading style.
Section II � Speed Reading Techniques
Chapter 4 � Space Reading
Beyond the edge of the world there's a space where emptiness and substance neatly overlap�Haruki Murakami
Section I discussed the formalities of speed reading�foundational steps that precede reading. Although these steps don't directly raise speed, they are important to the process.
This section presents techniques that directly impact reading speed and ability. As noted in the introduction, the section focuses directly on increasing one's ability to read more words in a shorter amount of time. It is the meat of this book, where you will learn to glide through text quickly and easily.
In order for these techniques to make sense, it helps to understand an important feature of the eye. The eye has the ability to process an image or object both as a whole and as a collection of individual parts. When looking at a friend's face, for example, the eyes and mind process the face as a whole rather than looking at individual parts, such as eyes, mouth, nose, and all the other minute features. This allows you to recognize the friend immediately. At the same time, if you wanted to focus on the individual features, you could do that as well.
Though, what would happen if you did focus on a single feature of your friend, such as an eyelash, nostril, or dimple? Narrowing vision to such a minute detail would hinder the ability to recognize the person. Such a restricted focus would require scanning other parts of the face and then putting all those parts together in order to recognize that individual.
This is how most of us read; we narrow our focus to each word or letter. Much like distinguishing a face, this process forces us to advance bit by bit�letter by letter or word by word�to absorb any significant meaning. If we are distracted or our mind wanders, we will miss the meaning of the entire sentence or paragraph and must start over.
This is not an effective way to read since, as you now know, the eyes and mind have the ability to see and process much more in a single glance. The solution, therefore, is to not focus on single words but rather to expand visual awareness and see groups of words at one time. This is the natural way the mind absorbs information from sight.
There are two ways to look at groups of words. The first method, called space reading, will be covered in this chapter. Space reading directs you to avoid looking at the words you are reading, but rather at the spaces in between the words. That's right�at the spaces between words!
You're probably wondering, How the heck will looking at the spaces between words improve reading speed and comprehension? The answer is that paying attention to the white space prevents the eyes from narrowing their focus, and thus fixating, on individual words. As a result, the eyes can pick up more information, just as when they look at a someone's face.
It's easy to spend hours explaining the whys and hows of this phenomenon with studies to back up the claim; however, it will be much easier to show you firsthand. Below is a two-sentence paragraph with a small dot in between each word. Read through the paragraph by glancing at each of the dots. Start with the first dot, then move to the second, then the third, and so on. Don't look at the words to the right or left of the dot�simply move your eyes from one dot to the next, and do so in quick succession.
Even � though � you � are � not � looking � at � any � of � the � words � in � this � paragraph � your � eyes � and � mind � are � still � able � to � pick � up � the � text. � This � happens � because � paying � attention � to � the � spaces � prevents � your � eyes � from � narrowing � their � focus � on � individual � words.
Amazing, right?
By focusing only on the dots�the spaces between the words�the mind was able to rapidly capture the text. As a result, you were able to read more, at a faster speed, and with greater comprehension. If you were unable to pick up the text, try this exercise again. Remember, simply look at the dots in between the words, and move swiftly from one dot to the next.
This is the essence of speed reading. You grab text as a whole instead of in individual parts. When doing this technique, don't analyze, evaluate, or verbalize the text either aloud or in your head. Simply maintain a steady rhythm and skim left to right across each sentence, from one blank space to the next, without stopping or trying to make sure you understand what is being said.
That's all!
Just as when you look at a tree, a car, or anything else in the environment, the mind picks up the information without you having to think about or work at it. That's what your marvelous eyes and brain are designed to do!
Then, to read faster, transition from looking at the spaces between every two words to looking at the spaces between every three words. Then every four words. With enough practice, you can advance to looking at only a few spaces per row of text to quickly grasp the information in that row.
Let's try the exercise again with the dots spaced between every three words. Below is the same paragraph as above, but with dots between every three words. As before, bounce your eyes from one dot to the next in quick succession.
Even though you � are not looking � at individual words � in this paragraph � your eyes and mind � are still able to � pick up the text. � This happens because � paying attention to � spaces between words � prevents your eyes � from narrowing their focus � on individual words.
With enough practice, you can raise your speed so you only need to look at a few spaces per line of text to grasp the information in that line, and do so with higher attention and comprehension
However, don't immediately jump to this level. Practice first with a space between every two words. Once comfortable there, move up to glancing at spaces between every three words. Move up to one space every four words only when you are proficient with three. You will eventually reach a level where you can absorb an entire sentence by merely glancing at two spaces, one in the middle-left and then the middle-right.
As you progress, make sure to work on expanding peripheral vision. That is, expand the ability to capture more words to the left and right of the space. The goal is to notice more and more words on each side. This will be discussed further in chapter 9.
Some people advance to such a level that they need glance only at one space�the one in the middle�to capture the entire line of text. They read by moving down one row to the next, gazing only at the space in the middle of each line. Combined with the other techniques in this book, and with dedicated practice, you too can achieve this level.
If you didn't see the magic in this or were unable to pick up the text the first time, try the exercise again. Remember, look only at the dots in between the words in the above paragraph, and move swiftly from one dot to the next. This time, try softening your gaze a bit.
In the beginning, avoid the need to comprehend what you are reading. Simply focus on developing the habit of looking at the spaces and moving from one space to the next. Understanding and comprehension will come naturally since the mind evolved to derive meaning from information the eyes take in. Trust the mind to construct meaning without conscious effort on your part.
The great thing about this technique is that it is not a skill that needs to be learned or developed; it is an innate ability that you already possess. It's the natural way the eyes and mind work to process information. Therefore, you need only change the habit from looking at words to looking at the spaces between those words.
Which brings us to the . . . 
Practice Drill
This drill will train the eyes to shift focus from looking at words to looking at spaces between words. To start, scroll back to the beginning of this chapter and reread it using the technique of space reading, which means moving the eyes from one blank space to the next without stopping. Remember not to analyze, evaluate, or try to make meaning. Your only goal right now is to bounce from one space to the next in quick succession.
After going through the chapter once, repeat the drill, but this time, move the eyes between spaces every two words. Make sure to do this through the entire chapter. It will go faster this time because you are stopping on fewer spaces. When you finish, begin again with every three words. Finally, reread the chapter while looking at spaces between every three words.
As you gain comfortability, reread this chapter one more time, looking at spaces every four words while also trying to make sense of the words and their meaning. You might need to go slower, because now, you are actively involved in registering the content.
After completing this step, practice reading while looking at spaces every four words on the materials gathered for the previous drill�articles, reports, and even email and social media posts. Get the eyes accustomed to doing this with big text, small text, text with wide columns, and short columns.
Looking at spaces between words is one technique that directly impacts reading speed and ability. The next chapter will cover the second technique, called chunking. Both methods keep the eyes from fixating on individual words, so that you can naturally soak in more information when reading.
Chapter 5 � Chunking
Being a Chunk is far better than being a Hunk�Kam Knight
In this chapter, you will learn another deceptively easy method to boost reading. It's called chunking. Unlike the first technique of space reading, which focused on looking at the spaces in between words, chunking involves looking at the words themselves. However, instead of looking at words one at a time, you glance at groups, or chunks, of words.
Chunking works on the same principal as space reading. As you learned, the eyes have the ability to process an image or object either in its entirety or in distinct parts. When looking at a distinct part, the eyes instinctively focus in on that part to the exclusion of all others. This causes us to miss everything else around it.
Consider what happens when a camera takes a picture of a close object. The background becomes blurred. Conversely, when there is no object in close view, the background is clear.
The same principle applies with our eyes. When we look at a word, the eyes' natural tendency is to narrow their field of vision to that one specific word, while disregarding the words around it. That leaves us no choice but to read text one word at a time.
Chunking opens line of sight to capture more words in a single glance. The eyes are not set on a single word of a sentence, but instead, on a block, or chunk, of words in that sentence. You look at a chunk, move to another chunk, then another, and so on.
Let's look at an example. Below is a paragraph very much like the sample paragraph in the previous chapter. This time, the paragraph is separated into chunks with the ""/"" character. Position your eyes on the first chunk, and look at all the words together as a whole. Then, move the eyes to the next chunk and then the next in rapid sequence.
Even though you / are not looking / at individual words / in this paragraph / your eyes and mind / are still able / to pick up the text. / This happens because / paying attention to / chunks of words / prevents your eyes / from narrowing their focus / on individual words.
As with space reading, you were able to capture the text without focusing on individual words. And just as with space reading, you effectively increased reading speed simply by changing the way you look at words. You may have thought that you wouldn't be able to read text more than one word at a time, but as you just experienced firsthand, the eyes and mind do, indeed, have the ability to grab a group of words in a single glance.
The key to this technique is not to grab words at random but to grab combinations that form a phrase. A phrase is two or more words that form a meaningful unit in a sentence. If you notice, the previous paragraph is broken into meaningful units: In this paragraph, at individual words, and your eyes and mind. These combinations have meaning, and such combinations help the mind pick up chunks as one large, meaning-rich word.
If possible, avoid combinations like:
/ this paragraph your eyes /
/ and mind are still /
/ the text. This happens. /
Such combinations are difficult to understand, and therefore, difficult to process. Consequently, they prevent you from reaching your maximum potential. At the same time, there isn't only one correct phrase combination either: different people can choose different chunks in any given sentence, which can still be classified as a phrase.
You've now learned two direct techniques to increase reading speed�space reading and chunking. Both techniques work on the same principal of softening the eye's gaze and moving over multiple words in a single glance.
Although both work on the same principal, they function independently of one another. That is, they can't necessarily be used together because it is difficult to effectively look at a space and chuck at the same time. When reading, you will either look at spaces or at chunks of words but not both.
Since the two techniques operate independently, it is best to choose one to develop. Neither is right or wrong, neither is better or worse. Both techniques integrate well with the suggestions in subsequent chapters.
It's really a matter of preference. Personally, I prefer space reading because it is easy and natural for me. All I have to do is think about spaces�and that's all. There is no strain or struggle. Though, you may feel that way about chunking.
The best way to determine which technique you prefer is to practice the drills in the two chapter. You might like both, finding that space reading works better with certain types of material, while chunking works better with others, which is perfectly acceptable. Whichever you prefer, refrain from using both techniques at the same time.
Practice Drill
This drill requires�you guessed it�rereading this chapter using chunking. First, reread the chapter chunking two words at a time. Then read it chunking three words at a time. Then, finally, four words at a time. With each pass, focus only on grabbing words in chunks and not on making sense of the words in the chunks.
Once you are comfortable grabbing chunks of four words, the next step is to pick out chunks that form phrases. This step may be challenging, so you may need to slow down considerably, even stopping to analyze whether a particular chunk makes up a phrase, or perhaps, a better combination exists.
Allow yourself to go as slowly as needed. It's what you and your mind need to develop a feel for what makes good phrases. This is why these practice drills are important�they provide the breathing room to do just that.
With consistent practice, you will find that picking out phrases becomes second nature. You will be able to do it with little effort; it will just happen. Still, you have to start somewhere, and there is no better place than with this drill.
Once you get the hang of picking out phrases, the final part of the drill is to read the chapter while making sense of how the phrases come together to form sentences and paragraphs. As before, take the exercise beyond this chapter and onto the other materials you pulled together.
As with anything in life, speed reading is about increasing habits that speed you up while decreasing habits that slow you down. So far, this section outlined two habits that speed up reading. Now, let's turn attention to a not-so-effective habit that slows it down.
Chapter 6 � Removing Subvocalization
Think before you speak. Read before you think�Fran Lebowitz
This chapter trains you to break a habit called subvocalization, which alone can double or even triple reading speed. Subvocalization is the act of pronouncing every word that is read. When subvocalizing, you either say words out loud, hear them spoken in your mind, or move your lips to their pronunciation. Any one of these acts is subvocalizing.
Subvocalization greatly reduces the speed at which you read by adding an unnecessary step, or steps, to your reading. In addition to seeing the word, you are also hearing and/or speaking it.
The problem is that speech is a relatively slow activity. Our mind can't say a word as fast as it can see it. This makes it impossible to read faster than we talk. By vocalizing words, out loud or in our head, we force the mind to read slower than its potential. Essentially, the mind is forced to perform two tasks at once.
Remember the exercise from the introduction, when asked to notice everything in the immediate environment, did you verbalize what you saw? Probably not. Or, do you verbalize everything you encounter while walking down the street? That's a building, that's a side walk, and there's a street sign...I see another building and now another street sign.
Of course not.
We don't do this. Instead, we take in what the eyes capture without adding the additional step of vocalizing.
If you did stop to vocalize it all, imagine how long that would take. You would have to walk significantly slower to ensure you caught everything. It's the same when we vocalize while reading. Our pace is significantly reduced.
And slower reading isn't the only side-effect of subvocalization. When subvocalizing, we increase the chances of getting bored. Most of our inner thoughts are spoken in a monotone, expressionless manner, and subvocalizing is often done in the same manner. In other words, we tend to read in the same unexciting tone that we use when talking to ourselves.
As a result, the text just drones on and on inside our head, and before we know it, we're tired, uninterested, and perhaps, even starting to daydream. We might assume the material we were reading was causing that boredom, but in reality, the cause was simply the sound of our inner voice!
What's more, by pronouncing every syllable of every word, you slow reading even further. Believe it or not, many readers actually take the time to carefully pronounce every word.
If unsure about whether you subvocalize, try this: while reading the next few paragraphs or pages in this book, notice whether or not your lips move, even slightly, or if you hear yourself say the words out loud. If you do either, you subvocalize. Though, don't be too hard on yourself, most people are guilty of this habit.
Subvocalization is a behavior that starts when we first learn to read, because we are taught to read phonetically. We read out loud to connect the right sound to the right word. This is necessary for the brain to learn the words and develop associations with those words.
Once we become fluent, we stop reading out loud but continue the phonetic process. We either start whispering these sounds in our mind or begin moving our lips so others can't hear us. Most people continue reading this way for the rest of their lives, hearing the little voice in the back of their mind and moving their lips to that voice.
Clearly at one point, vocalization was a necessary evil. However, once we've learned to read, subvocalization is no longer needed. Since the eyes and brain are capable of reading and comprehending all on their own, subvocalizing simply gets in the way of your true potential.
Also, as mentioned, information is received faster from sight than is received from hearing or speaking. Relying on sight alone immediately increases reading speed, because you go from glancing at words to directly understanding their meaning without any steps in between. As stated, simply by eliminating subvocalization, you can effectively double or triple reading speed right here and right now.
As beneficial as it is to silence the inner narrator though, it's not easy. As you learned, it takes time and effort to break long-lasting habits. Nonetheless, the following suggestions reduce the difficulty.
Close Your Mouth
First and foremost, close your mouth when reading. Talking activates many parts of the body, such as the lips, mouth, tongue, jaw, and throat. Subvocalization does as well but to a lesser degree. Despite being less, it still affects speed.
Keeping the mouth closed disengages these processes, thus preventing you from saying the words out loud or moving your lips to their pronunciation. You'll be surprised how much this single, deliberate action can curb the urge to verbalize.
Read Faster than Speech
Read at a fast-enough pace where you simply cannot pronounce words or think about their sounds. Humans speak one word at a time and not three or four. Apply the suggestions in the last two chapters to grab multiple words between each space or chunk.
The more words you grab simultaneously, the more you disrupt the habit of sounding them out. Do this quickly. Move between spaces or chunks so fast that the part of you that needs to sound out or hear the words can't keep up.
Hum
Another option involves humming. Hum a tune, a song, or a basic melody. Humming works because it preoccupies the vocal cords, so that you can't speak or whisper any words.
Humming also drowns out the voice in your head, along with any distracting noise in the immediate environment. If, for example, you are reading around noisy neighbors or loud machinery, humming can replace those annoying sounds with something more soothing.
As an added benefit, humming can set a rhythm and pace to your reading. To speed up reading, hum faster. If you are reading uncontrollably fast and need a way to slow down, hum slower. Humming is an effective way to control reading speed and pace.
The only drawback to humming is that in a public setting, it might distract or annoy others. In these situations, hum in your head; that is, imagine the sound of the humming. Or hum with the breath, breathing to the sound of the tune or song.
Humming is a slightly more difficult option to master because it involves engaging in two unrelated activities: reading and humming. They are two activities you've likely never done together, so it may prove challenging at first. But if you manage to apply humming and find it effective, it's a skill worth developing. And as with any skill, consistent practice makes it second nature.
Music
The last and most popular option to break the subvocalization habit is to listen to music. Play it loud enough so that you can't hear yourself think, because if you can't hear yourself think, you won't be able to hear yourself read.
Research shows that music without words or lyrics, such as classical, instrumental, or electronic music, are the best options for reading. Lyrics in a song compete with words in a text for the mind's attention. Without lyrics, extraneous words aren't getting in the way.
These are some ways to eliminate subvocalization. They are not difficult to implement but do require shifting habits, which isn't always easy. By sticking to them, you will start reading faster almost immediately.
Practice Drill
Choose one of the speed reading techniques you learned in the previous two chapters. Then, go to the beginning of this chapter, and as you space read or chunk through the material, tame the desire to subvocalize.
Begin by closing your mouth to adjust to reading without moving your lips. This will come naturally to those who already read this way, but for others, it will be a bigger struggle than it initially seems. After every few sentences, you may catch yourself unknowingly moving your lips.
Each time you catch yourself subvocalizing, stop and close your mouth before moving forward. To really ingrain this habit, any time the lips part, return to the beginning and start the exercise again.
Once you are accustomed to reading with mouth closed, advance to reading without hearing or sounding out any words. Use the space reading or chunking techniques to move through the words quicker than you can speak them. To create an even larger buffer, try humming.
Don't worry just yet about comprehension but only about moving through the text without engaging the verbal or auditory senses. When you can comfortably space read or chunk without any form of vocalization, read the passages once again, this time for comprehension. Remember to carry the practice to the other materials.
This wraps up Section II on the specific speed reading techniques. Now that you know the techniques, let's discuss ways to enhance them, which we cover in the next section.
Section III � Enhancing the Techniques
Chapter 7 � Fixation
Perhaps all anxiety might derive from a fixation on moments�Sarah Manguso
Hopefully, you've realized by now that speed reading isn't a demanding activity that requires enormous time, energy, and effort. The eyes and mind already possess the natural ability to read quickly; all you need to do is break a few habits and make slight shifts in the way you look at words. Shifts such as looking at spaces, chunking, and reducing, or even eliminating the habit of subvocalization.
This section offers strategies to enhance and refine these techniques, which will, in turn, enhance and refine reading speed and comprehension. As effective as the techniques in the previous chapters are, there are things you can do to make them even more effective.
The first involves reducing fixation. Though fixation sounds like a complex psychological disorder, it is simply the length of time the eyes stop and rest on a subject. Anytime we look at something, our eyes still themselves. This pause, called fixation, is the eyes' ability to stop moving so they can focus. If they didn't do this, everything in life would be a blur.
Fixation occurs during reading as well. When we read, our eyes stop and fix on words to see them clearly. They don't stop for long, but they do, indeed, stop with each and every word. This quick pause gives the eyes an opportunity to pick up the text.
In addition to fixating, the eyes also jump. As it relates to reading, the eyes jump from one word to the next. These jumps take place in between each fixation. As the eyes look at a word, they fixate. To look at the next word, they jump.
Our eyes are continually fixating and jumping, though it happens so fast that we don't realize it. When reading a 10-word sentence, your eyes will probably fixate and jump about 9 times.
To witness this process in action, close one of your eyes and place the tip of your index finger on the eyelid of the closed eye. With the open eye, slowly look left and right. You will actually feel distinct stop and go movements on the finger of the closed eye.
You can also observe fixation and jumping by watching others read. The next time you see someone immersed in a book, watch as their eyes move across the text. Notice that their eyes don't move smoothly; instead, their eyes make small, quick pauses and then jumps as they follow the line of print.
Since our eyes naturally stop to fixate on words, they present a mechanical barrier to speed reading. The fact that the eyes stop means, in that moment, they are unable to see any other word. Even though the pauses are for a split second, given the numbers of words in a document, they add up. The point is the more words we fixate on, and the longer we hold each fixation, the slower we read.
Fixation also reduces reading comprehension. Meaning is easier to pull from groups of words than from individual words or even single letters. Remember the face example from Chapter 4? It's difficult to make out a person's face by focusing on his or her individual features. The same is true with fixation during reading. The more you fixate on individual words, the more difficult it is to grab meaning from a sentence.
We falsely assume that slower reading means better comprehension. This may be true in some cases, but in most cases, the factors causing slower reading also cause lower comprehension. If you read slowly and still struggle with comprehension, you likely fixate too much.
Not to mention, fixation takes the fun out of reading. By fixating on every word in a sentence, it takes longer to get to the point the writer is trying to communicate. This creates impatience, lack of interest, and loss of focus. Losing focus causes comprehension to suffer further, and eventually, the desire to read altogether.
To increase reading speed and comprehension, it makes sense then to manage eye fixation. Although essential to reading�and to seeing in general�it can be reduced significantly.
There are two ways to do this. First, by reducing the number of words you fixate on. Second, by decreasing the length of time you hold each fixation. Let's explore both of these methods further.
Reduce the Number of Fixations
The obvious way to reduce fixation is to pick up more words each time the eye stops. You learned to do this in the last section through space reading, chunking, and limiting subvocalization. These techniques were designed for this exact purpose.
To quickly review, with space reading, remember to skip as many words as possible between spaces. When chunking, fit as many words into each group or chunk. And because subvocalization means sounding out, hearing, or moving lips to each word, those who read this way have no choice but to fixate frequently, since the eyes must stop to verbalize each word before proceeding. Removing subvocalization means you are not forced to make so many stops.
Employing space reading or chunking and limiting subvocalization will significantly reduce the number of words on which you fixate. Rather than stopping on each and every word, you can expand the capacity to capture three to seven words, or more, in a single glance.
Reduce Length of Fixation
Another tactic to reduce the effects of fixation is to shorten the time the eyes spend on each pause or fixation. Instead of staying on a fixation for an extended period, continue moving the eyes forward when reading. Don't slow down to contemplate the text�just keep moving to the next space or chunk of words.
Whether on one word or groups of words, the average reader fixates 4 times each second. That means each fixation is a quarter of a second. If that can be reduced even by half, it in effect doubles speed.
Practice Drill
The previous drill had you practice space reading or chunking while limiting subvocalization. In this drill, you will do that again but with shorter fixations.
Return to the beginning of this chapter, and while using the technique of space reading or chunking, reread the chapter slightly quicker than you just did or perhaps faster than you are comfortable doing. Remember to keep lips sealed and refrain from any form of subvocalization.
Then read the chapter again at a little faster pace. Look at the same number of words, but move faster than before. Reread a third time at a slightly faster pace. As before, don't worry about making sense of the material; simply foster the habit of reducing the amount of time you hold each fixation.
It may come as a surprise, but even though you are reading faster than is comfortable, you are still able to grasp meaning. You might not be able to hold on to the meaning for long or connect it to what came before or after, but for that split second, the content does register.
The problem that arises when we read fast is that we can lose control of our eye movements. They can start to zig-zag violently across the page. As a result, we are unable to fixate properly. The fixation becomes messy and careless, causing the eyes to stop on random words and spaces.
Refrain from letting this happen. Try hard to maintain control of the eye jumps and stops. If the eyes are moving too fast to control, slow down slightly until you regain control. As soon as control is regained, play with speeding it back up a bit.
Once you develop control of fixations at a faster pace, read the passage again, but this time, for comprehension. Finally, make sure to practice reducing fixation on the other reading materials you've gathered.
Now, let's look at the next barrier to speed reading called regression.
Chapter 8 � Regression
Regression lives on, not because of the unavailability of a better option but because of the inertia and fear�EverSkeptic
The last chapter explored fixation and how your eyes pause and fixate on words when reading. This chapter will examine regression, which is similar to fixation, but instead of stopping to look at words you are reading, you stop to go back to words you've already read. So, regression is the act of reading the same text multiple times.
Regression is common among readers; the average reader regularly revisits passages he or she has already read. Readers may go back either to pick up missed words or to make sure that their understanding is clear. Whatever the reason, studies show that people spend as much as one third of their time rereading words.
Based on this statistic, it is easy to see why regression is counter-productive. First, as the word implies, reading speed regresses. It is like taking two steps forward and one step back. And when revisiting an entire page or chapter, it's like taking several steps back.
Regression also reduces comprehension. Our minds take meaning from what we just read to help us understand what we are about to read. By skipping back to a previous sentence, paragraph, or section, we can't help but lose track of the point that was being currently made. So, returning to a passage after regression, you may have forgotten what was just read, making it difficult to understand what you are about to read.
Most importantly, regression breaks flow, and speed reading is all about flow. It's about syncing the pace of the eyes to the rhythm of the mind. As the eyes see words, the mind processes them. As soon as the mind finishes processing one set of words, the eyes pick up a new set. Like a well-oiled machine, the end of one process triggers the beginning of a new one.
Regression breaks this flow and rhythm, forcing the machine to be re-started. Even worse, by backtracking and regressing often, the mind and eyes never get a chance to develop a harmonious flow. This severely limits reading potential. Overall, regression doubles, or even triples, reading time and may not even result in better comprehension.
Reasons why we regress
To break this pattern effectively, it helps to understand why we regress in the first place. Some of the reasons are obvious while others are not. Let's take a closer look at our motivations for regression.
It's Natural to Regress
Much like fixation, regression is a natural visual process. Just as our eyes constantly fixate and jump when looking at something, they also swing back and forth. They repeatedly move backward, then forward, and then back again.
Watch a person's eyes, without paying attention to any other feature, and you will see just how often their eyes shift back and forth. It's what the eyes do. Those whose eyes move back and forth often tend to read slower because they regress more frequently.
Lack of Concentration
Another cause of regression is lack of concentration. We read but do not pay attention to the text. Our eyes see the words on the page, but the mind is in la-la-land. Since our mind is elsewhere, it therefore doesn't process anything that comes in. As a result, we must revisit the passages where we lost focus.
Subvocalization
Subvocalization can also cause regression for the simple reason that our eyes move faster than our mouths. When the eyes race ahead of the mouth, we must stop and go back to verbally process what we visually saw, thus causing regression.
Wrong Fixation
The most common reason for regression is that our eyes fixate on the wrong spot. As we read, we may lose our place on the page, or we may land our eyes on a spot much further along than we intended. As a result, we must go back and find the right spot.
Habit
As I keep stressing, anything performed long enough becomes a habit. If you regressed when learning to read, that pattern may have internalized as a habit. Now, you regress simply because you've become used to doing it. You don't choose or even want to do it; it just happens simply because your eyes and mind have a habitual need to regress.
That's how habits work. They make us do things we have not necessarily chosen to do, want to do, or that is even helpful to do. Habits may even persuade us that we missed something important to encourage us to revisit a passage.
Avoiding Regression
Understanding the causes of regression puts us in a better position to reduce and stop it. From the explanations, you probably already thought of some ways to do that. Let's discuss them now.
Have a Clear Purpose
As explained in Chapter 1, purpose directs attention and focus. With a well-defined purpose, the mind's awareness opens, and its focus changes. It hones in on the task of reading and seeking the precise information you seek. Since the mind is immersed in the content, it does not get lost in thought and miss what is being read, eliminating the need to regress.
Stop Subvocalizing
Since subvocalization can be a culprit in regression, obviously strive to limit it as much as possible. Don't get caught in a dance of trying to match the speed of the mouth with the eyes, tripping yourself up, and having to backtrack.
Index Card
One tried and true method to reduce regression is with the use of an index card. Find an index card the same width of the column you are reading. It is best to use the unlined side of the card.
Begin at the top of the page and slide the card down over each line of text as you read. With the text out of sight, you're unable to look back and regress.
Continue reading and pulling the card down over each line of text that is read until reaching the end of the page. Do the same on the next page. Of course, the urge to peek and remove the index card will arise on occasion, but do the best to resist that urge.
Control Fixations
Although instructed to reduce the number and length of fixations, do so in a controlled manner. Don't be erratic and impulsive with the jumps and stops. Be deliberate in how the eyes move and where they land.
Don't feel pressured to push your reading too hard. Always strive to pick up additional text with each glance and to shorten the time of each glance but not if doing so causes fixations to stop on words you did not intended.
This rule is especially important for beginners. When learning a new skill, beginners hunger to become experts right away. Instead of taking the time to develop their skills, they push through with full steam. Going full steam without developing control causes slips that lead to regression.
Keep in mind, this isn't a contest. Focus on control rather than speed and speed will improve naturally.
Practice Drill
The previous drill added speed to the practice of space reading or chunking while reducing subvocalization. In this drill, you will refrain from regressing while doing all this.
As before, begin at the intro and read through the chapter without regression, even if you miss or feel like you missed something. If it helps, use an index card to cover what has been read so you are not tempted to peek back.
Don't worry if you fail to grasp the content. The point right now is to change the urge to regress. You will learn to comprehend more than you've ever comprehended by pushing yourself to move forward.
By practicing this drill, you'll notice that you regress considerably more than you thought. Much of your regression behavior is outside of your conscious awareness or control. Without realizing, you probably regressed a great deal while applying the drills in earlier chapters. Being conscious of this limitation puts you in a better position to manage and overcome it.
At times, the initial urge to regress may be easy to resist, though as you forge ahead, the urge grows stronger. It may grow so strong that it actually becomes a distraction to reading. You won't be able to concentrate because an irritating sensation to revisit a particular section will push you to think something important is being missed. The urge will incessantly annoy you to go back.
On occasion, that urge may be so overpowering that it makes you to lose interest or give up trying to read further. It may argue that there is no use in reading on because whatever was missed will create difficulty in learning what's to come. That logic may kill the drive or enthusiasm to continue reading altogether.
Resist that urge!
Keep plowing forward, even if you feel like you missed something important or don't understand an explanation. Condition your brain that it is not okay to regress, and that you will not regress, no matter how great the temptation. This is how the brain will learn that it must be attentive the first time you read a passage.
Reread this chapter several times while refraining from regression. Then, practice on the other materials.
Ample ground has been covered to take reading to the next level. To round out this section, the next chapter introduces the concept of visual range.
Chapter 9 � Visual Range
Strategic vision is the ability to look ahead and peripheral vision is the ability to look around, and both are important�Carly Fiorina
Speed reading, as we've discussed, is about picking up more words in a single glance or fixation. In order to effectively develop this ability, it's critical to expand visual range.
Visual range is the ability to see objects beyond your direct line of focus. When looking at something in front of you, it's easy to see that object because the eyes are set directly on it. It's difficult to capture details on either side of the object unless you move your eyes.
By expanding your visual range, you can see both what's in front of you and on both sides without the eyes moving. This increases the capacity to capture more words in a single glance.
Expanding visual range requires using peripheral vision, or what you see from the corners of your eyes. Peripheral vision encompasses everything that the eyes can see beyond whatever is directly in front of them. In other words, everything we see from the sides while looking ahead makes up our peripheral. It is the largest part of our visual field.
Peripheral awareness is important because it gives us the ability to react to what's happening around us, not just what's in front. When driving, for example, the peripheral pays attention to the movement of cars to the left and right so that we can focus straight ahead. When walking down a hall, our peripheral stays on guard for anyone who might unexpectedly rush out of a door that we are passing. In both cases, peripheral vision helps us avoid collisions.
We use peripherals more often than you might think. Whenever we try to look at someone without them knowing, we employ peripheral vision. When playing sports such as basketball or football, we engage them to keep track of the players on the field and what they are doing at any given moment.
Although we naturally engage peripheral vision in these activities, we rarely engage it while reading. This is especially true when we've been reading in the same manner for our entire life.
Using peripheral vision is a smart way to enhance reading. In addition to seeing the words directly in front, you can also see words from the corners of the eyes. This naturally widens your visual range so that you can capture more text in a single glance.
Peripheral vision is vital for many reasons beyond widening visual awareness. First, the brain processes information from the sides 25 percent faster than it does from direct vision, which is why the brain is able to react to dangers so quickly. Engaging the peripheral also softens the eyes' gaze so their focus doesn't narrow down to a single word. Ultimately, using peripheral reduces regression or extended fixations, since one side of the peripheral range can catch words the other side may miss.
If you've never worked on expanding peripheral range, chances are that it isn't very wide. Therefore, the number of extra words it can capture is limited. If that's the case, then in addition to training yourself to use the peripheral while reading, you also want to widen it. Widening the peripheral vision further increases the eyes' capacity to capture words from both the left and right corners. Developing this is a key to developing the skill of speed reading.
This chapter both trains and widens peripheral field of vision. Through the following six exercises, you will become comfortable using your peripheral vision while gradually widening it.
Exercise 1 � Sticks and Straw
For the Sticks and Straw exercise, grab a straw and two toothpicks. Begin by placing the straw horizontally on a desk or table one foot from your eyes. Now, grab one toothpick in each hand, and as you stare at the center of the straw, insert the toothpicks simultaneously into the ends of the straw�one toothpick through each end.
When doing the exercise, look directly at the center of the straw; don't shift the eyes to either the right or the left. Instead, use your peripheral vision to see both ends. Challenge yourself by inserting both toothpicks into the ends of the straw at the same time. Working on one straw end at a time will not stretch peripheral vision.
Exercise 2 � Off the Wall
This exercise requires a ball that fits into one hand, such as a tennis, racket, or bouncy ball. Stand in front of a wall and choose a spot just above eye level. With one hand, bounce the ball off that spot on the wall and catch it with the other hand. Then, bounce it back into the first hand. Repeat this action over and over.
When tossing the ball, don't take your eyes off that spot in front of you. Instead, use your peripheral vision to both throw and catch the ball. Look straight ahead as you use peripheral vision to follow the ball leaving one hand and bouncing off the wall to arrive in the other. Be patient as it will take a few repetitions to develop the necessary hand-eye coordination.
If this becomes too easy, take it up a level. Instead of throwing the ball at the wall, throw it over your head from one hand to the other. At a certain point, the ball will leave your peripheral range, which will challenge your peripheral to track the speed of the ball, so it can predict when it will come down.
Exercise 3 � Open Your Awareness
This exercise does not require the use of any physical props. Instead, choose a target at eye level where gaze can be comfortably rested. If you are inside, look at the wall or at a picture in front of you. If outside, pick a tree or a street sign in the distance. Wherever you choose to look, hold your gaze and eyes there.
Now, without moving the eyes, gradually begin to notice things to your right and left. Continue to stare at the target while paying careful attention to more and more details in your peripheral range.
This exercise can be done almost anywhere, anytime. For example, while sitting at a desk, gaze directly at the center of the computer screen and take note of everything the peripheries see on and around the desk. If on a bus, choose a point of focus and note the number of people on board, where they are sitting, and what they are wearing, in addition to observing other features of the bus, like windows, seating arrangement, or advertisements.
This exercise can even be performed while walking down the street. Use peripheral sight to notice features of buildings and people that you pass.
Exercise 4 � Shultz Table
The Shultz Table is a table or grid, usually with 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 dimensions, filled with numbers, letters, or words. The goal of the table is to focus attention on the text in the center square while using peripheral vision to identify as many numbers and letters as possible in the outer squares. It is one of the best ways to open visual awareness.
To illustrate, let's use the 3x3 Shultz table below. Fix your gaze on the center square, and then notice the numbers in the surrounding squares. The object is to identify all the numbers in less than one minute.

The 3x3 square might have been too easy, so let's try the 4x4 table below. Since there is no center square, direct your gaze at the center of the table. Then, pick out the first 4 numbers in the inner squares, and then the 12 numbers in the outer squares.

The 5x5 table below takes this exercise up a level. The same rules apply: identify the 8 numbers around the center square, then move outward to the 16 numbers in the outer square. Again, the object is to identify all the numbers in less than one minute.

Employing the Shultz table is a great way to train and expand peripheral vision. Practice using the tables until you can comfortably see the outer numbers with your peripheral.
If you become too familiar with the numbers in the tables provided here, feel free to create your own tables. Simply draw 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, or even 6x6 grids and populate them with random numbers, letters, or words.
Shultz tables can also be found online using the following link: http://www.onedollartips.com/tools/szultz/ Simply type in the number of rows and columns you'd like, and the site will generate a set of custom tables on which to practice.
Exercise 5 � Raining Letters
Below is a table with three columns of letters. Direct your eyes on the letter in the center column while reciting the letters to the left and right. For example, stare at the letter S in the middle of the first row as you try to make out the letters M and N to the sides of the S. Then, move down to the next row and look at the letter X as you attempt to decipher the letters to its left and right. Continue down each row until the end.

Much like the Shultz table, this first example probably wasn't too challenging, so let's try one with 5 columns. Again, fix your eyes on the letter in the center column, and move them down while reciting the letters in the two columns to the right and left of center.

If 5 columns weren't challenging enough, the next table takes it up a notch. Remember, the object is to identify all the letters to the immediate left and right of the center column, then continue moving outward to make out the letters in the columns to the far left and right.

Exercise 6 � Centered Text
Now that you are comfortable using your peripheral vision, let's begin using it on written material. Below is a poem by W.B. Yeats with a vertical line drawn down the middle. Aim focus on the vertical line, and with your side vision, notice how many words you can make out to the left and right. Move down the vertical line, picking up the words on both sides until you reach the end of the poem.

If this is your first attempt at applying peripheral vision toward reading, you might only see one word to the left and one to the right, and likely, they will be blurry. That's okay. Don't let that stop you from continuing down the poem and grabbing what you can.
When you reach the end, go back and do the exercise again. Repeat this exercise regularly and often, stretching your ability to see words on both sides. Once you can clearly see one word on either side of the line, try for two words until they too become clear. Keep working to comfortably see more and more words to the left and right of the center. 
With persistence, you will gain the ability to look at the center of a page of any book, article, or essay and quickly make out all the words in an entire row. It will take effort and patience to achieve that level, but it is possible. At this level, you'll be practically inhaling information, because all you'll have to do is direct gaze to the middle of a row of text and work down, one row after the next.
You'll notice that this poem is not particularly easy to read or understand, but that's the exact reason it was chosen. The idea is to not become too familiar with the text too soon. When the content becomes familiar, the tendency is to work from memory rather than sight.
Nonetheless, eventually the poem will become familiar enough so you won't need to look as carefully to identify the words to the left and right. Once that happens, apply this exercise on other material. To do so, open a document in a text editor, like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Apple Pages. Next, center the paragraphs in the document. Then, as advised, starting at the top, look at the middle of each row, and practice making out as many words to the left and right of the middle.
These 6 exercises offer some powerful ways to train and expand peripheral vision. They are built around the principal of fixing your eyes on a fixed spot straight ahead, while opening awareness of the surrounding details.
Be aware, it is possible you might unknowingly move your eyes to the left or right during the exercise to catch a better glimpse. This can happen so quickly, you may not realize that you are doing it, believing that you were looking straight the entire time.
Be cautious of this as you want to capture the side details with peripheral vision, not with direct vision. Otherwise, it defeats the purpose of the exercises.
Also, it helps to use soft focus instead of the hard focus that we commonly use to read. This means relaxing the eyes similar to the way you look at pictures. A soft focus makes better use of peripheral vision. It also puts less strain on the eyes, making it easier to read.
In addition, be sure to do all six of the exercises. People tend to stick to one or two that they like or that are easy, and skip the rest. Few take the time to stick toothpicks into straws or bounce a ball off the wall. They would much rather sit in front of their computer working the Shultz table.
Though any one of these exercises is helpful on its own, the benefits compound by doing them all. Practicing one exercise will improve your ability with another, so make it a point to run through all 6. Each one takes a few seconds to a few minutes to complete, so the time commitment is minimal, yet the benefits gained are vast.
Practice Drill
Before starting any drills, run through the exercises several times to get comfortable using and expanding peripheral vision. The drill will have more impact after going a few rounds with the 6 exercises outlined in this chapter.
As you notice visual range expanding, apply your newly opened awareness to a reread of this chapter. Combining instructions from previous chapters and drills, practice moving through the text with wider visual awareness. Try to catch one additional word to the left and right beyond your current ability.
Until now, you've been asked to space read or chunk every 3 to 4 words. With a wider peripheral view, attempt to grab 4 or 5 words. Go through this chapter a few times picking up 4 to 5 words in between every space or chunk. Continue the practice on the other materials gathered for the drills.
Once space reading or chunking every 4 to 5 words while limiting subvocalization, fixation, and regression is in reach, advance to 5 to 6 words. After reaching that level, move up to 6 to 7 words and on up.
Though bear in mind that moving up in levels takes time, effort, persistence, and practice. No reader can progress so quickly in a single sitting. You'll need to practice widening peripheral, then practice the drills, then go back to the exercises to widen peripheral further, then back to the drills again over an extended period.
This concludes section III on enhancing the speed reading techniques. Remember, fixation and regression are enemies of speed reading, and wide visual range a friend. Now, let's look at how to better understand written material.
Section IV � Improving Comprehension
Chapter 10 � Reading for Ideas or Main Points
Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events�Eleanor Roosevelt
As noted in the intro, speed reading is not reading unless comprehension exists. Without comprehension, you are merely looking at words really fast. It's for this reason this book dedicates an entire section solely to comprehension and grasping the meaning, message, and content of the material you read.
The first step to comprehension is seeking out the main points. When reading, it is critical to pay attention to the main idea or overarching point the writer is trying to communicate. That is, it's one thing to make sense of a single sentence or paragraph but a whole other to grasp the overall message of a passage.
Paying attention only to details, such as facts, dates, and descriptions, without giving thought to the main points, can lead to missing crucial information essential for understanding and memory. While studying history, for example, you might read about events and be oblivious to the country or person to whom this information relates. Or, you might read instructions without grasping the bigger picture of where the individual steps will lead.
To illustrate, think about how you would like a friend to respond when asking about his or her weekend. Would you prefer to hear, I went on vacation? Or would you prefer, I pulled out my luggage, packed it with clothes, zipped it up, drove to the airport, checked in my bags, flew to London, took a taxi to a hotel, and sat in front of a beach drinking mojitos?
This is how people read. They pay attention to the details, but not the main points. They pick up the packing, driving, and flying without understanding it is for vacation. The main point is vacation, the rest are details. If you don't grasp the main point, you will get lost in the details.
To illustrate further, think back to Chapter 7, which discussed the eyes' need to stop and fixate in order to focus. This was explained not to demonstrate the amazing features of these organs but instead to illustrate the effect of fixation on reading speed and comprehension. The main point of the chapter was to explain how reducing the number and duration of fixations can increase reading speed.
If you failed to catch how the detail of fixation affects the big picture of reading speed, you would miss the fundamental lesson of the chapter. You might know what fixation is and why it is important to vision, and even be fascinated by how often the eyes jump and pause, but that knowledge won't help improve reading.
Again, this is how most people read, especially students. They notice the details but miss the bigger context or point. As a result, they get lost and don't understand what they've read.
To improve comprehension, pay attention to the main points or the big picture, so to speak, and the broader context. When sifting through a lot of details, take an occasional step back to identify how those details relate to the overall message the author is trying to communicate.
Most books, especially academic ones, are written with main points in mind, so it should not be difficult to identify them. Sometimes, it's as simple as asking, what is the point of this sentence, paragraph, or passage?
This is not to imply that main points are more important than details�both matter. If a friend says he went on vacation, you naturally want to know more. On the other hand, if they simply recite a bunch of activities they engaged in without explaining that it was for a vacation, you'd either be really confused or think they'd lost their minds.
A good way to recognize the main points is to recognize the levels embedded in any written composition. It begins with understanding the meaning of a sentence, then how that sentence fits into the paragraph, and then how the paragraph supports the larger chapter. Finally, how the chapter supports the overall piece.
A writer doesn't pick random words to form sentences, then casually combine those sentences into paragraphs, and haphazardly order the paragraphs into chapters. Enormous work and intention go into the craft of writing to give the final work structure and coherence. Just as there is a purpose to why we read, there is a purpose to why writers write. To drive the point home, there is a point that a writer is trying to make, and it is our job as readers to understand that point.
You may think you understand the point of a passage when reading, but unless you are actively seeking it, you will likely miss it. So always be on the hunt for the bigger meaning, idea, or purpose. Don't get caught in only the details.
The process can also be applied in reverse. Since the preview step gives you a general overview of a written piece, determine the overall message or point of the material during preview. Then, while reading, watch for how the author delivers and supports that message with the details. Think about the ways each chapter supports the overall book, how the individual paragraphs reinforce each chapter, and how specific sentences develop the paragraphs.
For example, the overall point of this book is to teach simple techniques to improve reading speed. Each chapter presents a specific technique that helps readers with that goal. The techniques are defined, explained, and illustrated within the subsections and paragraphs of the chapter.
Looking at chapter 8 on regression, the first subsection defines regression and its impact on reading, the second explains the causes of regression, and the third offers advice on how to overcome them. Diving further, each paragraph presents an argument, a cause, and a solution. Within the paragraph, each sentence supports the point the paragraph is making.
The more ideas you can identity and the more you can figure out how the details support those ideas, the easier it will be to comprehend the material fully. You will evolve from merely reading words and sentences to grasping whole concepts and positions. Comprehension will advance beyond facts and dates to truly see what is being communicated in the material and why.
Practice Drill
Think back to the introduction and the last 9 chapters of this book, and reflect on the main points discussed in each chapter and how the details supported the points.
There's no need to do this from memory�just yet. Revisit the chapters and review the content. In addition, scan the table of contents to get a better sense of the structure and organization of each chapter.
Think about what each chapter is trying to communicate and why. Although the chapter titles give away the main point, go beyond restating the title, and describe the underlying message. For example, as the title of chapter 2 suggests, the main point is preview. What is preview, and why is it important?
Each chapter also offers an assortment of details, including examples, illustrations, anecdotes, instructions, and exercises, to support the main points. Think about what these details aspire to communicate. They are not there by accident.
For example, what was the point of the lengthy explanation in Chapter 2 of why humans make mistakes or the story of my friend in Belize? The stories weren't provided for entertainment. How did they support the overall topic of preview?
Again, if you focus only on the details of the story, you might miss the underlying purpose or argument. We all fall into this trap. It is easy to be captivated by a fascinating fact and settle on that as the main point.
After reviewing the chapters in this book, find the main points in the sample materials. If you've been doing the drills in the previous chapters, you should have read them multiple times by now. Think about what the writer of each piece wishes to share.
The concept of mining for the main point transitions nicely into the next chapter, which discusses the structure of a paragraph. This valuable knowledge will increase the speed with which you grasp meaning and intent in anything you read.
Chapter 11 � Topic Sentences
If a thesis is a road map to a paper, then a topic sentence is a guide to a paragraph�BCCC Tutoring Center
The previous chapter taught the importance of identifying the main points or ideas when reading. It also provided two ways to identify those points. This chapter will provide another way to do that, which involves recognizing the principal thought or purpose of a paragraph.
As most know, a paragraph is a group of sentences that discusses one main idea. The idea can describe a place, detail a character, illustrate a process, or reveal information about an event. It can also argue or explain a point or help develop an argument or point.
Paragraphs are the fundamental units of all writing because they are the building blocks, much like bricks to a house, which hold together a piece of writing. An idea in one paragraph leads to an idea in the next paragraph, and so on, until the reader comes to understand the big picture that the writer is trying to convey. 
Since each paragraph discusses a distinct idea, as readers, our task is to locate that idea in each paragraph. A fail-safe way to do this is to identify the topic sentence�where the idea is clearly stated. To understand what a topic sentence is and how to find it, it helps to understand paragraphs at a deeper level.
In formal writing, a paragraph consists of three parts: a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence.
As mentioned, the topic sentence presents the paragraph's main idea. It acts as the introduction that tells the reader what the rest of the paragraph will be about. The topic sentence also holds facts and details together. When a writer presents a series of facts, details, or descriptions on the same idea, those facts are grouped together and summarized with a topic sentence.
As the name suggests, supporting sentences support the topic sentence. They describe, illustrate, communicate, or explain the topic sentence using facts, reasons, examples, definitions, comparisons, and other pertinent info. Supporting sentences sell the idea made by the topic sentence.
The concluding sentence brings the paragraph to a close. It does this either by restating the topic sentence or by summarizing the information presented in the supporting sentences. Since the concluding sentence restates and summarizes previous information, it is similar to, but not exactly the same as, the topic sentence. Concluding sentences are often used to lead the reader into the next paragraph.
In many ways, paragraphs resemble hamburgers. The top bun is the topic sentence and the bottom bun is the concluding sentence. Although the buns look similar, they are not exactly the same. Nonetheless, both buns hold the core of the hamburger together in the same way that topic and concluding sentences hold together supporting sentences in a paragraph. Such is the nature of paragraphs.
Let's use the previous paragraph to illustrate. The first sentence, In many ways, paragraphs resemble hamburgers, is the topic sentence, setting the stage for what will be discussed, which is how paragraphs resemble hamburgers. The next three sentences support and expand upon the relationship between paragraphs and hamburgers. The last sentence, Such is the nature of paragraphs, summarizes the main point while also concluding the paragraph.
This is the formal structure that teachers taught us, if we were so inclined to pay attention. The format is used in a wide variety of written materials, such as books, articles, magazines, essays, and journals. The format is particularly popular in academic and non-fiction works.
The goal is to find the topic sentence in each paragraph and understand how the other sentences detail, elaborate, or describe the claim the topic sentence makes. This practice will yield greater insight into how the paragraph fits into the overall piece.
So, how do you find the topic sentence? While it may appear anywhere in the paragraph, it is most often the first sentence, because it introduces what follows. Reviewing the topic sentence in the previous example, In many ways, paragraphs resemble hamburgers, you'll notice it is the first sentence. In fact, majority of the topic sentences in this book are the first sentence in the paragraph.
Also, topic sentences tend to be short and general with limited content. That is because they use supporting sentences to provide the necessary details. By reviewing the topic sentences in this book, you will notice that they are general and relatively shorter than the other sentences.
Another way to identify a topic sentence is that it often poses a question to be answered. The statement, In many ways, paragraphs resemble hamburgers, raises the questions: Why are they like hamburgers? Or, How do they resemble hamburgers? This makes a reader want to dive into the supporting sentences for answers. If unsure whether or not a sentence is the topic, try turning it into a question. If the other sentences seem to answer that question, then you have identified the topic sentence.
Sometimes, you can spot the topic sentence by finding a word or two that repeat in the rest of the paragraph. In the previous paragraph, the topic sentence is, Another way to identify a topic sentence is that it often poses a question to be answered. We can safely assume this is the topic sentence because a) it is the first and most general sentence in the paragraph, and b) one of the words in the sentence, question, shows up 2 additional times. This is a good indication that this sentence is likely the topic sentence.
Furthermore, topic sentences often contain transition words that smoothly lead the reader from one paragraph to the next. These include words that show continuity, like next, another, also, in addition, or words that express disagreement, like despite, nevertheless, however, and although. I'm a big fan of transition words as they really help refine the flow of my writing. A quick glance at the previous 5 paragraphs and you'll notice the frequent use of transition words. Not surprisingly, the sentences that use these words are also the topic sentences of their respective paragraphs.
Lastly, it's not uncommon to find topic sentences following a transition sentence. Transition sentences, like transition words, bridge the end of one paragraph to the beginning of the next. They are always the first sentence of a new paragraph, so you are likely to find the topic sentence immediately following them.
Let's revisit the following paragraph that appeared earlier in this chapter:
So, how do you find the topic sentence? While it may appear anywhere in the paragraph, it is most often the first sentence, because it introduces what follows. Reviewing the topic sentence in the previous example, Think of paragraphs like hamburgers, you'll notice it is the first sentence. In fact, a majority of the topic sentences in this book are the first sentence in the paragraph.
Although the first sentence in this paragraph may seem like a topic sentence, it is merely a transition sentence that smoothly transitions the reader from the previous paragraph.
The sentence that follows is the true topic of the paragraph as it introduces the main thought. And if you notice, it has the word first, which shows up several times throughout the passage. This increases the likelihood that the sentence is the topic. You don't see the words in the transition sentence, like find, repeated in the passage.
Although the topic sentence is often the first sentence in a paragraph, it can show up elsewhere. It can appear as the second, third, and occasionally, even as the final. When it comes last, the supporting sentences are used to develop arguments and examples that build to the main idea announced at the end.
The goal when reading is to be on the hunt for the topic sentence. It will help you understand the thought or idea of a paragraph. Although a thought or idea of a paragraph is not the main or overarching point of a composition, it will allow you follow the writers line of thinking form one paragraph to the next to get to the main or overarching point of a composition. Topic sentences are what keeps the conversation going from one paragraph to the next.
Practice Drill
This drill will test your ability to find topic sentences. Identify which sentence is the topic sentence in the following paragraphs taken from http://www.laflemm.com:
The 1920s began on a note of economic optimism. However, by the end of the decade, America was sinking into an economic depression that left the country reeling. Automobile sales, the heart of the early twenties consumer boom, were bottoming out. Housing starts fell, along with manufacturing output. In the fall of 1929, the stock market crashed with investors losing as much money as the government had spent during all of World War I. Those without investments on Wall Street were facing even grimmer prospects. Jobs were disappearing as factories and businesses closed their doors. For many working people, it wasn't clear if they would have a roof over their head or enough food to feed themselves and their families.
Although the first sentence seems like it could be the topic sentence, it is only a transition sentence that paves the way for sentence 2, the true topic. Sentence 1 discusses the high point of the early twenties, but that discussion doesn't continue.
Sentence 2 talks about the country reeling, and that reeling is described in the remaining sentences. The second sentence also uses the phrase economic depression, and although the other sentences don't repeat those specific words, they use similar ones, such as bottoming out, fell, crashed, and losing, all words associated with economic depression. You may also have noticed that the second sentence begins with the transition word however. Given the evidence, it's safe to assume that this is the topic sentence of the paragraph.
Let's examine another example. Read the following paragraph and find the topic sentence.
The rules of conduct during an examination are clear. No books, calculators or papers are allowed in the test room. Proctors will not allow anyone with such items to take the test. Anyone caught cheating will be asked to leave the room. His or her test sheet will be taken. The incident will be reported to the proper authority. At the end of the test period, all materials will be returned to the proctor. Failure to abide by these rules will result in a failing grade for this test.
The first sentence is the topic of the paragraph. Although no major words from the first sentence are repeated, we do see variations of the word examination or words that are related to exams, such as test, cheating, test sheet, and proctor. The conclusion effectively restates the first sentence and summarizes the paragraph about following the rules.
Let's look at one final example. This one is longer and more difficult.
Whenever a dictionary gets revised, the editors have to select those words worthy of making its pages. Sometimes that decision is difficult because it's just not clear which words have entered the English language long-term and which ones reflect momentary fads that will be gone in a year or two, along with the words that described them. The following words, though, don't fall into that ""iffy"" category; they seem to be keepers, deserving of an entry in any comprehensive, or complete, dictionary. The word ""telenovelas,"" for instance, refers to the Spanish version of soap operas. Given the popularity of this particular entertainment form, room for it will have to made in the T section of every desk dictionary. The same is true for ""Bollywood,"" the name given to movies made in Bombay, India and modeled on old Hollywood films that were heavy on passionate romance, singable tunes, and superficial plot lines. It's also hard to believe that references to I-pods are going to disappear anytime soon; so ""IPO,"" initial public offering and ""Ipoh,"" a city in Malaysia, should get ready to make space for a new entry. It's also probably true, too, that the word ""gninormous,"" meaning ""huge"" or ""gigantic,"" is not just a flash in the pan. Thus it's very likely to turn up in updated dictionaries, probably accompanied by ""technostalgia"" (a longing for simpler forms of technology that have been replaced)
If you picked the first sentence as the topic, you are incorrect. If you chose the second sentence, you are also incorrect. I mentioned this example was difficult. The topic is in sentence three. Sentence three introduces words deserving of entry into the dictionary, something the rest of the paragraph lists. Also, the word keeper vibrates throughout the text.
Don't be discouraged if the last example proved challenging. It takes time and practice, but eventually, you will be able to spot the topic sentence in the first read-through without a second thought.
Continue practicing with the passages in the other materials. Pick out the topic sentence in each paragraph.
Chapter 12 � Improve Vocabulary
As vocabulary is reduced, so are the number of feelings you can express, the number of events you can describe, the number of the things you can identify�Sheri S. Tepper
To truly ameliorate the dexterity to subsume written material, one must possess a wieldy argot. Without a philistine vernacular, it's perverse to elucidate any prose. You would be quixotic to speed read without the aptitude to antithesize the words. Otherwise, it will create a gnawing sense of ennui.
The previous paragraph probably didn't make much sense. It contains big words that make reading and understanding a challenge. As a result, it slowed your reading and was likely draining to get through, depleting any motivation to continue.
This exercise was meant to illustrate the importance of vocabulary on reading speed. As you noticed, not knowing the definition of a word dramatically slows reading. Our eyes fixate on unfamiliar words longer, and there is a greater impulse to regress. You're not aware of it, but you can't help but read slower.
A strong vocabulary is essential to increasing reading speed. Studies show that people with a strong vocabulary not only understand more but read faster. The stronger the vocabulary, the more words the brain can recognize and process in the moment. This helps us pick up meaning quickly, and the quicker we pick up meaning, the quicker we read.
Unfortunately, building vocabulary is not easy. Unlike the previous techniques, this is not one that can be cultivated in a few weeks or even months. It takes time and effort to expand verbal repertoire (a list or supply of skills). The process can even be boring and tedious, causing one to skip developing this skill altogether.
Though, this is a critical area that should not be skipped.
Speed reading will not work with a weak vocabulary. A weak vocabulary increases fixation, regression, and disrupts the pace and rhythm. Truth be told, it's almost pointless to speed through text with opaque (difficult to understand) words, because even though they could be read fast, you wouldn't understand their meaning. It helps to have the basics down first, and that includes strong vocabulary.
Most people shriek (cry or shout) at the thought of raising their vocabulary level, thinking that it would be boring or time consuming, not to mention difficult. Many throw in the towel on speed reading, especially those who don't have a strong command of the English language, simply because they feel this is too large a hurdle to overcome.
Traditional methods of building vocabulary, which involve memorizing words in a dictionary, can be boring, time consuming, and challenging. Fortunately, this chapter doesn't take that traditional approach. Rather, it presents unique and creative techniques that take little time and effort to follow. Rather than memorize a dictionary, these techniques expose one to more words in day-to-day life while naturally engaging the brain to pick up their meaning and context.
Circle Unfamiliar Words
A great place to start is with material you are already reading. When you stumble on words that are unfamiliar, circle them and move on. Once the passage is finished, return to the circled words, and look up their definition. Then, reread the sentence or paragraph with the new definition in mind. Notice how the sentence or paragraph with the unfamiliar word stands clear now that you know its meaning. This system deepens vocabulary without needing to stop mid-sentence to look up words.
Use a Thesaurus
Use both a dictionary and thesaurus when looking up the meaning of words. Although dictionaries provide the definition of a word, a thesaurus offers synonyms, or alternative words with similar meanings. Synonyms not only elevate the ability to understand a word but also expose you to multiple words. This way, the meaning of several words is learned at the same time. For example, if you look up the word replete and see that brimming, rife, and awash share a similar definition, you've added three additional words to your vocabulary.
Read a Variety of Materials
Different materials use different types of words. For example, science fiction and fantasy books use a lot of imagery words. Romance novels employ words that are descriptive. Words used in academic texts are specific, while how-to books use general language. Fashion and gossip magazines continually change and evolve expressions. Reading a variety of materials exposes the mind to a wider range of words in meaningful contexts.
Listen to Audiobooks
Audiobooks are a great way to learn the meaning of words. The brain understands words based not only on what is said but on how it is said. When a word is spoken, auditory cues such as tone, manner, and accent aid the mind in grasping its meaning. Remember, language was at first entirely verbal. The mind evolved to comprehend spoken words before written words.
Another benefit of audiobooks over traditional books is that you can listen to audiobooks while doing other things, like driving, exercising, or lying in bed. All you need to do is press play and go about your business. This means you can go through more books than otherwise�and more books means exposing yourself to more words.
Learn Prefixes and Suffixes
A prefix is a letter or combination of letters added to the beginning of a word to create a new word with a different meaning. For example, adding the prefix un to the word happy creates the word unhappy with a completely opposite meaning to the original word. Adding over to work creates the new word overwork. Ironically, the term prefix uses a prefix itself, as pre (which means before) is joined to the word fix (which means to attach), creating a word that means attach before. This perfectly describes its function of attaching letters before a word.
A suffix, on the other hand, is a letter combination added to the end of a word, like ish to child to form childish or er to work to form worker. Often, the suffix won't change the meaning of the word but will alter its function, as when ly is added to the word quick to form quickly or ness to dark to form darkness.
Learning the meanings of some of the common prefixes and suffixes will hint at the definition of words that use them. Spending a little time learning a small list of terms goes a long way toward learning and understanding a larger number of words.
As the chapter on preview eluded, the mind loves to make predictions and is always on the hunt to figure out what something means or to guess what's going to happen. Prefixes and suffixes help our minds make better predictions. If an unfamiliar word is presented in the correct context, the mind can use the prefix or suffix to accurately guess the meaning without having to pull out a dictionary.
The following two tables list prefixes and suffixes commonly used in the English language. Study and ingrain these terms, and notice how they show up in the words you read.

Talk to People with Strong Vocabulary
As recently mentioned, language is, first and foremost, verbal. We learned to speak before we learned to read or write. So, nothing connects terms and definitions directly to the brain like conversing with people.
This technique only works, of course, when talking to people whose vocabulary is strong. Speaking only to people with a weak vocabulary will not produce the desired results.
Most of us know people who are eloquent speakers�those who have a knack for injecting the right word at the right time to accurately convey a thought, feeling, or situation. If you don't know people like that, seek them out.
Many circumlocute (avoid or withdraw) from such people, either because we don't feel smart enough or we prejudge them as being arrogant. Avoiding them, unfortunately, will not help grow vocabulary. Don't feel shy or embarrassed to ask people to define unfamiliar words they've used in conversation.
An easy approach is to ask: What do you mean by . . . ? Or, What do you mean when you say . . . ? For example, if they use the word replete, you can ask, What do you mean by replete? Or, What do you mean when you say replete? Asking a question this way doesn't reveal that you are unaware of a word's meaning�it simply signals that you seek clarification.
Though, it's unnecessary to use such a roundabout approach. It is fine to ask a person directly for a word's meaning. Most people won't embarrass or make you feel dumb for seeking a definition. In my experience, people respect those who show enough care about what they are saying to seek clarification.
After learning a word, practice using it in conversations with other people. This will reinforce memory and understanding of the word. Don't be surprised if others begin asking you to define the words you're using!
Study More Words
Finally, a tried and true method to expand vocabulary is simply to study more words. This doesn't mean mindlessly memorizing the dictionary, though if that's your thing, go for it! There are a variety of alternate and fun ways to study vocabulary using apps, software, games, and even online videos. These options allow one to learn faster and more thoroughly than would a mere dictionary.
These are some creative ways to grow your lexicon (the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge). This is definitely a long-term approach to improving reading speed. As stated, don't expect results in hours, days, or even weeks. Frequent and consistent effort must be applied over several months to reap the benefits.
Although this skill takes work, it is worth the time and effort. Just 3 months growing vocabulary will yield a lifetime of benefits. Not only will this accelerate reading but also the ability to understand more people and more things, thus increasing your overall intelligence.
People often assume their vocabulary will develop simply by reading more, or by reading more challenging literature. Relying solely on reading to build vocabulary is a passive approach that is not very effective. It's a shortsighted view that limits potential. To develop vocabulary, you must actively work on it.
Practice Drill
Apply the tips outlined in this chapter to the sample materials. Read through a piece and circle unfamiliar words. After reviewing the samples, look up definitions of circled words with both a dictionary and thesaurus. Then, practice using these words in everyday conversation.
This completes the section on improving comprehension of written material. To recap, reading for main points, identifying topic sentences, and building vocabulary are the three keys to unlocking the capacity to learn. If you are going to put in the time to read, make sure to do it right.
Let's now proceed to the chapters in the final section. 
Section V � Additional Tips
Chapter 13 � Remembering What You Read
Some people are born with wonderful memories and have no trouble keeping things straight. Those born without this incredible ability have to find ways to strengthen their memories�Jane Peters
When I was in Brazil a few years ago, I met an interesting woman who loved books. I mean, she really loved books. So much so that she was always reading. And I mean always reading.
She didn't have a steady job or regular work schedule. In the evenings, she was a hostess at a restaurant, and during the day, a tour guide but only when she had tourists to guide. In between, she picked up odd jobs.
In between that, she was reading. Even at work, she was reading. As a hostess, one of her duties was to invite tourists walking by the restaurant in for a meal. If there was a lull in traffic, even for a minute, she would turn to the book she hid in the corner.
Since then, I've met others who are as passionate about reading. They'll read just about any type of material, from books and magazines to newspapers and novels.
One thing I notice about these people is that although they are well read, they often don't remember much of what they've read. Sure, they remember it in the moment, or perhaps for a few days, but not for much longer than that. They simply forget the majority of the content.
In my memory improvement material, I teach students not to rely on their automatic mental processes to remember information. Believe it or not, we forget up to 80 percent of what we hear, see, or learn within a few hours of hearing, seeing, or learning it!
This applies to reading as well.
If no attempt is made to remember material, the brain will not retain it. You'll have a sense that you do in fact remember, but as soon as you try to recall that information, you'll realize that in actuality, you can't.
This applies to all types of content, whether fiction or non-fiction, a lengthy book or short article. It also applies to all types of readers, whether a college professor or department store cashier, a newbie or bookworm, like my Brazilian friend. Our minds cannot possibly record everything that enters its awareness. A great deal must be discarded, including much of the material that we read.
Suffice to say, if you are going to put in the effort to read something, you'd probably like to remember it. It would be pointless to spend all this time learning to speed read if at the end of the day 80 percent is forgotten.
So, in addition to reading a passage, take action to reinforce your memory of it. When we read non-stop, our brain automatically replaces the old information with the new. By the time we reach the end, we likely have forgotten much of the beginning or middle.
One way to prevent this is to do what I term Recall and Review. While reading, stop at some point and recall what you just read or learned up to that point. You can stop either every half hour or so or stop every chapter, lesson, or subsection.
It is important that the content is recalled from memory rather than looking at notes or going back to review the passage. Allow the information to come to mind on its own without looking at the material.
When confident that you've recalled everything, revisit the passage or any notes you took to see if what you remembered was accurate and complete. It can help to underline important areas while reading, then go back to review those areas. Adding this process of review after recall ensures that you remembered everything correctly and that it remains fresh.
It's a simple step that takes very little time but can have a significant impact on reading and memory.
The fact is if you don't actively do something to remember what you read, you're going to lose it. It's not a question of if, but when, and that when is usually within hours of reading.
A great time to practice recall and review is during breaks. After returning from break, quickly recall what you read so far before moving ahead. For example, if you read two chapters of a novel during the morning commute, the next time you pick up the novel again, take a minute to review what you read that morning before reading further. This will not only refresh memory of the previous material but will segue smoothly into the new content.
Recall and review is especially useful when you reach the end of a piece. After finishing a book, article, or other piece of writing, take a moment to reflect on the entire composition. Try to recall as much as possible, and when you can't recall anything further, quickly review the material to ensure that what you remember is accurate and complete. This will cement the information in memory.
Now let's discuss what to focus on during the recall and review. If reading a story or novel, think about the events that occurred in the story since you last read�what happened to the characters and what did their dialogue reveal? Were new characters introduced, did old ones leave, or were there major twists or turns in the plot? See if you can recall scenery or elements of scenes that were important to the story or that stood out.
With non-fiction literature, use the suggestions in the previous section and target main points and topic sentences. Can you recall the key points the author made? What details did the author provide to support his or her claim? Think about any information that was fascinating, though don't assume that because a fact is fascinating that you will automatically remember it. Also, keep in mind that what you found so captivating may not be the main point!
When you first attempt this exercise, you may not be able to recall much. You were attentive and engaged while reading because you understood the material, but now you're drawing a blank. It's as if the brain held the content only long enough to understand the next sentence or paragraph before throwing it out.
If this describes your experience, then you now understand how the mind disposes 80 percent of what is read, sometimes within minutes or even seconds of reading it.
That's why the recall and review exercise is so vital. It trains the mind to retain what is being read. If the mind knows that it will be called upon to remember a passage, it will work harder to remember it. Since it knows the information will be used later, it will think twice before throwing it all out.
In effect, recall promotes concentration. It's a natural byproduct of the exercise. Suddenly, you begin paying more attention to the content because the mind is aware it will need to recite the content later. All you need to do is develop the habit of regularly recalling and reviewing written material and concentration will improve naturally.
If a book takes a week to finish, and throughout the week, you take a few moments to regularly recall the material, your memory and comprehension will be far greater than if you read the book twice or even three times. Information won't disappear like it does for so many others.
As with purpose and preview, most people prefer to skip this step. They would much rather move on to the next assignment than recall and review what they just read. You too might be inclined to skip this step, but understand that this advice is meant to foster memory and comprehension, not to force you to do things you dislike. To improve memory, learning, and comprehension, add this valuable step of recall and review.
Practice Drill
Recall what you read this chapter beginning with something easy, like the main point or title of the chapter.
Next, can you recall how the chapter started? Yes, it started with a story about a woman I met. Do you remember where we met? What about the story I told about her? Right, she loved books. How did I use that story to lead into the discussion of this chapter?
What else can you remember? Do you remember why recall and review is important? How much of what we read, hear, and see do we lose within an hour? Were specific instructions offered in this chapter? If so, what were they?
Once you have tried to recall as much as possible, review the chapter to see if what you remembered is accurate and complete. If this is your first attempt at mental recall, you probably missed many points. Even veterans of this technique miss something. That's why it helps to review afterward, to ensure that nothing is missed.
Now it's time to practice on the materials gathered for the drills. There is no need to reread these materials, since by now, they've been read several times. Simply try to recall the content, then review to gauge how completely you remembered everything.
In the beginning, recall can be aggravating. While attempting to arouse memory, the mind draws a blank. It knows what was read, but in the moment, it doesn't want to work on retrieving it. Trying harder only raises the aggravation. If you can push past the mind's resistance, the next challenge is that you can't articulate the content as effortlessly as the author. This occurs because you've likely never practiced the art of recall.
Recall, as you've hopefully gathered from this drill, requires plenty of practice. It must be done repeatedly to integrate it into a habit. In the beginning, it will feel like the memories have to be pried out of your mind. Overtime, the need to pry fades and eventually disappears.
As explained, the mind slowly realizes that the information will be requested later, and so, it works increasingly harder to pay attention and remember. The more you exercise recall, the harder the brain will work, and the stronger concentration and memory will become.
You don't even have to focus directly on improving concentration and memory in order to strengthen and enhance them. You simply need to work consistently on recalling and reviewing information you read, hear, and see, and memory and concentration naturally improve.
In order to recall what we read, we must pay attention. But a devious little habit called daydreaming can get in the way of our ability to concentrate. The next chapter discusses the disruptive nature of daydreaming and ways to manage it.
Chapter 14 � Visualize
Reading is an active, imaginative act�Khaled Hosseini
Hopefully, I have succeeded in demonstrating that speed reading is about making slight shifts in habit that speed you up while reducing habits that slow you down. This book has covered many habits that slow you down, such as fixation, regression, and subvocalization. There is one more habit that slows reading, and that is daydreaming.
We all fall into daydreams at one time or another. It often happens during activities that are relaxing or activities that we dislike or would rather not be doing . . . such as reading. Too often, the mind wanders when reading, thinking about a vacation, winning the lottery, or becoming king or queen of our inner circle.
Truth be told, daydreaming might present the biggest hurdle to reading. When daydreaming, the mind is everywhere except on the material. It becomes easy to read for hours and hours without making sense of a single sentence. Although the eyes glide through the text, none of it registers because the mind is occupied processing the daydream.
Everyone experiences these moments, some almost daily. In truth, I wouldn't be surprised if you were daydreaming right now.
It goes without saying then, that to improve concentration, and therefore, comprehension and memory, you want to limit daydreams while reading. The problem is that daydreaming, like many processes inside the mind and body, is not under conscious control. It just happens. An idea in a sentence will trigger a thought or image in the mind, and without consciously realizing that daydreaming has started, we are carried away. We may not realize that we are lost in the dream until much later.
Although everyone is prone to daydreaming, it occurs more with some people than others. Some are wired in such a way that they can't stop fantasizing. Day in and day out, they journey from one fantasy to another. If you are one of these people, it's likely affecting more than just your reading. It's not that you don't want to pay attention; it's that the mind won't allow you to process anything beyond those mental images.
Since we're not able to eliminate daydreaming completely, the best thing we can do is learn to manage it through visualization. Visualization is the act or process of forming images in your mind. It's similar to daydreaming, except instead of letting the mind run the images, we sit in the director's chair and take conscious control of the scenes.
Though, instead of creating random scenes, you sketch images expressed by the words you're reading. When reading a novel, for example, you would visualize the characters, the scenery, and everything that happens to the characters just as the author describes. If reading about a process, visualize each step or phase of the process from beginning to end. If, on the other hand, the material is a tutorial or instruction manual, visualize exactly how each step should be performed. This is the essence of visualization during reading.
Keep in mind the goal is to visualize and read at the same time. So, form mental images of sentences as you read them. Do not wait until the sentence, paragraph, or passage ends to begin visualization�simply allow the two activities to occur simultaneously. Also, do not stop at each sentence to complete the image, but move from sentence to sentence, forming mental images along the way.
As you can imagine, this can be challenging to do. Truth be told, its more challenging than any of the other techniques in this book. Trying to form an image while reading forces the mind to perform two separate activities at the same time. The brain must pick up and make sense of words, and at the same time, create a visual representation of the words' meanings.
If you are not used to creating visual images, then doing so while reading can be overwhelming. You may experience fixation, regression, and brain knots as you figure out how to visualize a particular sentence. By making it a habit to read and visualize together, you will become accustomed to the process. Images related to the text will form instantly, and you will glide along passages while forming and manipulating images.
Though, you must start somewhere.
To ease into the process, practice with works of fiction, such as novels or poetry. This type of work tells stories and tends to be highly descriptive, which translates easily into visual images. In fact, such literature naturally lends itself to being visualized. Images will automatically appear, like a movie, right in your head and all you have to do is allow them to form as you read. 
Once visualizing works of fiction becomes comfortable and natural, move on to news articles and reports. Even though news is factual, journalists present these facts in story form, thus why they are called news stories. Since they are presented like a story, they usually contain descriptions that are easy to visualize.
The goal when reading news stories is to picture the events and incidents being described. If a story reports a fire at a suburban lake house in which 3 people were rescued, picture a burning house by a lake with firefighters rescuing the 3 residents.
The next level up is history. Much like news, history tells stories, except these stories are about the past. Think of history as outdated news. Historical information is often presented in a less exciting, mechanical fashion, but these accounts still contain elements that are conducive to visualization. Reading history will bridge you into visualizing text that are more challenging.
For example, when reading about Rome, picture where the empire first came into being and how it spread throughout Europe, parts of Asia, and Africa. Replay major events and battles as described, and imagine how they shaped the empire. For each leader introduced, such as Caesar, Augustus, or Constantine, visualize him coming to power, giving orders, leading armies, and setting policies.
History segues nicely into science. You wouldn't think science to tell stories or have descriptive elements, but they do. Though science stories are a little different and not quite as apparent. To some, they may not be so interesting either.
Nevertheless, science offers something that other types of writing do not. It describes parts and processes, like parts of an atom, cell, and ecosystem or the process of condensation, digestion, and photosynthesis. These are easily visualized by seeing the various parts and how they converge as a whole, or picturing the steps and how they flow together in harmony.
For instance, when reading about the organs of the body, you would picture where each organ is located and the function it performs. See in your head the heart pumping blood, the stomach digesting food, and the liver breaking down toxins. Also, draw out how all those organs interact with one another.
If reading about plants, visualize the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy or the route water travels from a plant's roots through the stem and up to its leaves and buds. As additional information is provided, insert it into the mental movie.
Practicing with materials in this order will help you adjust to reading and visualizing simultaneously. If your ability to create images is weak, you might work on developing this skill before applying it to reading. Let's discuss effective ways to do this.
The first way is to visualize lyrics of songs. Do you listen to music? Of course you do! Next time you're jamming to your favorite tune, visualize the lyrics.
Let's use the Beatle's classic Hey Jude as an example. As you listen to the lyrics, picture the events the lyrics describe, one by one. It's not necessary to know what Julian Lennon (the subject of the song) looks like. Simply picture a young boy whose parents are getting a divorce. As the song continues, picture this boy and the troubles the lyrics express him going through. Visualize what is happening in each line or moment in the song.
To do this effectively, you must pay close attention to the lyrics. The sensations and feelings that music elicits have a way of putting us into a dreamlike state, and once you slip into that state, instead of visualizing the lyrics, you begin to daydream. You have to overcome this temptation in order to produce the exact picture the lyrics paint.
Another option for learning the important skill of visualization is listening to audio books, an activity previously suggested for building vocabulary, so in effect, you are killing two birds with one stone. Audiobooks are great for developing visualization because hearing is a passive activity that we do naturally. It's easier to visualize what we hear than what we read, which has us focus on two things at once. This means listening frees more conscious resources to apply toward developing images.
In addition to audiobooks, it might help to practice with radio plays or radio dramas. There are lots of recent ones easily available on the net, some as podcasts, some from public radio, plus the old ones from the 30's and 40's.
Visualizing while listening transitions effectively into visualizing while reading them. Simply use the tips offered on how to visualize written material, and apply it to audible material.
After honing your skills using these suggestions, you can apply visualization to almost any material. The process will become natural, and you will move through text both reading and seeing it�truly seeing it.
Again, visualization is not an easy technique to master. You'll have to practice on a significant amount of writing before the act of smoothly translating written words into verbal images becomes natural. It's well worth the effort because visualizing while reading provides a host of benefits beyond managing daydreams.
First, it helps you engage with the material. The standard approach to reading involves staring at black text against a white background, which can get boring�and fast. That black text can also start to jumble together and sound similar. Visualization, on the other hand, gives life to text, making it vivid, colorful, and above all, real. Instead of passively absorbing information, you become actively involved, and at times, even experience the material firsthand.
Second, visualization enhances memory. As explained, vision is our primary sense and the majority of the brain's power is used to process visual information. This applies to memory as well. It's much easier to remember pictures than words. Many of our strongest memories are of visual experiences.
Finally, and most importantly, visualization aids comprehension. We've all heard the maxim a picture is worth a thousand words. That's because pictures are the language of the mind. Seeing something happen makes it easier to understand, much more so than merely reading or hearing about it. If you can translate words into images, your comprehension of written material will soar.
Practice Drill
Reread this chapter using the technique of visualization. Read a sentence and try to visualize it. Then, read the next sentence and visualize that. Move from one sentence to the next sentence, creating a mental image or movie the words describe.
You may find that not every sentence lends itself to being visualized, so you will have to get creative and take leaps in imagination. If a sentence doesn't automatically conjure an image, sit with it until it does.
If you are unaccustomed to visualizing while reading, read the sentence first before visualizing it. After becoming accustomed to the sequence, read and visualize simultaneously. Then, go back over the sentence a few more times quicker and quicker each time.
Review this chapter several times, adding the skills practiced in previous drills: space reading or chunking, employing peripheral vision, and reducing subvocalization, fixation, and regression.
The next, and final, chapter moves away from speed reading and on to the very thing that makes reading possible�the eyes. The chapter will enhance your awareness about how much work these organs do, the level of respect they deserve, and ways to maintain their longevity to ensure many healthy years of reading to come.
Chapter 15 � Eye Health
The eye is the jewel of the body�Henry David Thoreau
As with any organ in the body, most of us take for granted how hard the eyes work and everything that they do. The eyes labor nonstop to help us see and make sense of the world. This includes making sense of words, whether they're on a street sign or a billboard, in a text message, book, magazine, or on a flier.
To do this, the eyes are in constant motion; moving up and down, side to side, backward and foreword, as well as fixating and jumping numerous times per second.
Given all that the eyes do, they are bound to become overworked and tired. Therefore, it's crucial to take care of them. That includes stretching and strengthening the muscles of your eyes, relieving strain and stiffness in and around the eyes, and making sure they get the oxygen and hydration they need.
This chapter presents exercises to keep the eyes in tip-top shape. They are simple�simpler than any other exercise in the book�yet extremely effective at giving the eyes the workout they need. Doing them daily will improve the strength, flexibility, and range of motion of your eyes.
And strong, flexible eye muscles go a long way toward improved reading. You will focus better, capture more text in a single glance, make precise stops, experience less strain, and as a result, move through text quicker. Eye strength and flexibility are essential to performing all the movements necessary to increase reading speed and expand peripheral vision.
Exercise 1 � Left and Right
Straighten your back, relax the shoulders, and look forward. Without turning your head, move your eyes, and look as far to the right as possible. Pretend you are trying to get a glimpse of your right ear. Hold there for one second.
Now, slowly move your eyes in the opposite direction. While keeping your head straight, scroll your eyes as far to the left as possible. This time, try looking at the left ear. Hold for one second.
Perform this right-to-left then left-to-right motion 10 times without moving your head.
Exercise 2 � Eye Roll
With head facing forward again, gaze up at the ceiling. Rotate your eyes clockwise to make a complete circle, rolling them to the right, then down, left, and back up toward the ceiling. Try to be smooth and fluid in your movements as you notice objects in the furthest corner of your peripheral vision.
Do this again in reverse. Rotate the eyes counterclockwise by looking left, then down, then to the right, and finally, back to the top.
Repeat each direction 5 times, exaggerating the movement to stretch those muscles as much as is comfortably possible.
Exercise 3 � Figure 8s
Look straight ahead and make figure-8 motions with the eyes. Starting from the center, move your eyes up and to the left. Next, round the eyes to the top and down to the right. Bring them back to the center to start the bottom half.
Move the eyes down and to the left, round down to the bottom, up to the right, and back to the center again. As with the previous exercise, do this in both directions, and repeat each direction 5 times.
Exercise 4 � Plus sign
1. Look straight ahead.
2. Move the eyes to the left then back to the center.
3. Move the eyes to the right then back to the center.
4. Move the eyes up and back to the center again.
5. Move the eyes down, back to the center once more.
6. Repeat 5 times.
Exercise 5 � Scream and Squeeze
Open your eyes and mouth as wide as possible as if you are screaming. Allow all the muscles in your face, such as your lips, cheeks, forehead, and jaw to get a deep stretch. Hold for 3 seconds.
Now, squeeze the eyes and mouth shut as tightly as you can while also tightening the muscles in your face, neck, forehead, and jaw. Hold for 3 seconds.
Repeat this exercise 5 times. Remember that all of the muscles in the face are interconnected, so stretching the face muscles indirectly releases tension in the muscles around the eye.
Exercise 6 � Blinking
Sit comfortably in a chair, keeping your shoulders relaxed as you look directly at a blank wall.
Close your eyes, and hold them closed for half a second. Then, reopen them.
Do this 10 times.
Exercise 7 � Eye Massage
Sit straight, relax your shoulders, and close your eyes. Take your index and middle fingers and place them gently over each eyelid.
While applying light but firm pressure, gently move the right fingers in a clockwise direction and left fingers in a counter-clockwise direction. Repeat this circular massage motion 10 times. Then change directions for another 10 repetitions.
Once finished, use your fingers to massage the bones around the eyes, including the eyebrows. Again, apply light but firm pressure with your index and middle fingers while making circular motions.
Eye Breaks
In addition to doing the aforementioned exercises daily, give your eyes regular breaks throughout the day. Staring at text for long periods dries out the eyes, because they stop blinking as often as they should. It also weakens their muscles. This causes the eyes to work harder to maintain focus and even to remain open. Taking regular breaks, albeit momentary, gives the eyes a much-needed respite.
Instead of reading or sitting in front of a computer for hours on end, stop every hour or so and disengage for a few minutes. In that time, avoid looking at text or at a screen of any type or size. Instead, stand up, walk around, and grab a glass of water or even a snack.
In addition, direct vision on an object about 20 feet away. If it helps, gaze out the window. Maintain that focus anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes. Refrain from moving your eyes during that time as doing so defeats the purpose of the exercise. Simply focus attention on an object in the distance.
Simple eye breaks like these, taken throughout the day, give the eye time to relax, and when they're relaxed, they're less likely to become strained.
These are a few ways to relax and strengthen the eyes. Although these exercises are not meant to correct eyesight, you'll find that after doing them, your vision will be clearer. Another benefit of the exercises is that they significantly reduce headaches, migraines, muscle pain, and dry eyes associated with concentrating and focusing on tasks for extended periods.
Repeat the exercises at least once a day. You don't have to do every exercise every day, but choose one or two for each session. I do one exercise first thing in the morning and another before going to bed. Throughout the day, I do them as needed to relieve and refresh my eyes. If you do the same, you'll find that your eyes will feel stronger and better equipped for the constant stream of text that they encounter on a daily basis.
Conclusion
Congratulations, you've reached the end of the book! As promised, speed reading is a straightforward activity that requires shifting from looking at individual words to looking either at spaces between words or combination of words while keeping the inner narrator silent.
To further enhance speed, reduce the length and number of fixations, eliminate regression, and expand visual awareness, and voila, you're reading multiple times faster than ever before.
If you remember, Chapter 13 discussed the need to perform review and recall. If no action is taken to remember what was read, the majority of it will be forgotten within a few hours. All that will be left is a feeling that you remember the information.
Let's do some recall and review now so the lessons stay fresh.
Revive what you read and learned in Section I? Take a moment to consider the topics discussed in the three chapters of that section. Was there something that stood out as particularly important or that made an impact on your thinking or reading method?
Think also about the concepts you disliked. Did you find something annoying�something that you already knew or heard before? Don't disregard the areas that you resist or find annoying, because they offer important clues to growth and development.
For example, if you disliked the chapter on building vocabulary, it might be because you struggled with vocabulary in school, don't feel capable of having a strong vocabulary, or you simply dislike studying definitions. The areas we resist in life often present challenges that we are not ready to face or feel capable of confronting.
Do this level of recall and review for the 5 sections in this book. Do you remember all of the sections? Or the chapters within the sections? What about the exact order of the chapters?
Once you recall the chapters, think about the content. What were the major points, lessons, or techniques discussed in each chapter? How were they discussed, and in what ways did the details support the main, overarching topic? How about the instructions, exercises, and drills each chapter presented?
Put forth your best effort to elicit as much as possible. Recall deepens the neural pathways to memories stored in the brain. The more you recall a fact, the deeper those pathways become, and the longer you are able to hold on to them. So, work really hard to recall everything. The more of the lessons you can recall in this moment, the longer it will stick, which means the more you will remember to put into practice.
A good way to aid recall is to think about information that is related to, or discussed, in close proximity to what you do remember. If you can elicit memory of chapter 8 on regression, can you elicit the chapter that came before or after it? If you remember Exercise 2 � Eye Roll in chapter 15, can you remember the other exercises? What about going a step further and reciting the instructions of those exercises?
Using what you do remember is a great way to trigger or aid recall of other items. So, when you have difficulty evoking information you've read, try to remember any fact, element, or detail and use that information as a springboard to remember similar facts and details.
Once you recall everything, go back through the book to verify whether or not your memory is complete and accurate. You probably won't remember everything. There will be areas that you miss, which is to be expected.
As we've learned, the mind often holds a thought just long enough to understand the next sentence or paragraph. This makes it nearly impossible to remember everything in one pass. As the author of this book and someone who teaches memory improvement, even I am unable to recall the details of every chapter. So, it's important to go back and review the material to make sure that your memory is accurate.
Now that your memory of the lessons is strong, it's time to put the information and techniques to use. Choose a chapter and focus on developing the skill taught in that chapter.
It's not necessary to do this in order�begin with a chapter that you found challenging or one that will offer the most benefit. You might even start with one that is easy just to encourage yourself to begin. Then work up to the difficult material.
Either way, don't wait for a reading assignment to practice these skills. Repeat the exercises in the chapter over and over again until you master the technique. Remember from the introduction, practice is essential for integrating the techniques into your reading routine. Otherwise, the moment you pick up a book, old habits will take over.
Once the old behaviors are engaged, it's difficult to disengage them. You'll make excuses by saying that you'll apply the techniques next time, with the next material, or in the next session. You will likely make the same excuse the next time, and the time after that, until you forget much of the information you learned here. It's a common pattern that prevents progress.
That's how sly and devious habits are in keeping people in old patterns and routines, even when those habits admittedly don't work for them or when better options exist. So, practice every chance you get, and you too will master the art of reading a 200 page+ book in one hour.
The key takeaway is practice, practice, and practice!
I sincerely hope you enjoyed the advice offered in this book. If so, please leave a positive review of it on Amazon. Even if it is a few words, it will encourage others to take a chance on improving their reading speed, comprehension, and memory.

"﻿What are the benefits and drawbacks of globalization? How can we mitigate the drawbacks?

With increasing trades and interactions between countries, globalization is becoming a spotlight. However, it is noteworthy that when globalization benefits countries, it also has its shortages.

On the one hand, globalization can benefit from individuals to nations. Firstly, globalization introduce consumers a wider range of products and services from foreign countries. This makes it accessible for people to a variety of high-quality goods, providing more economical options for consumers, triggering consumers' desire to go shopping, therefore boost the whole countries economy. Secondly, globalization enables countries to learn from each other in terms of technology, cultures and other significant fields to stimulate innovations, new ideas, and diversity.

On the other hand, the drawbacks of globalization are also quite obvious. For example, it can enlarge the gap of wealth, raising the problem of inequality in classes, also between countries. During the process, migrations can be inevitable. But while countries have access to a large amount of cheaper labor, especially developing countries, the unemployment rate in the country will increase, which is harmful to citizens in lower class, but benefits the ultra-rich plutocrats. Nevertheless, I assume globalization is an inevitable process, as the high level of communication technologies and continual trade transactions between countries. We should try our best to minimize the downsides. For example, the government can subsidize those who need help.

"﻿Persona is a series of JRPG (Japanese RPG) video games that perfectly manifests the story core of the Hero's Journey, the character archetypes of Jung, and the symbolic archetypes of tarot cards. Let's first discuss its character design.
Persona combines a fantastic otherworld based on Jung's psychology with a realistic school environment. The game provides a unique gameplay of overcoming shadows (enemy) from the collective unconsciousness with the power of friendships the player builds in normal life. The protagonist's friends each have an elaborate design and personality that moves the plot forward.
Persona adopts a novel and mysterious setting for archetypes of characters, which is Major Arcana in tarot cards. According to tarot cards, every card of 22 Major Arcana represents a picture of a different stage in one's life, while every card describes a special character in a certain circumstance. Thus, each Major Arcana helps to sculpt characters' personalities and plights faced by different characters in their lives or minds.
For instance, Maiko in Persona 3, represented by The Hanged Man card, is a girl who just entered primary school. This child is confronted with the torturous situation of her parents' heated arguments and plans to divorce, and decides to leave home by herself, fitting the symbolic meaning of The Hanged Man, which is a person in a pressing dilemma who tries to seek the opportunity to break into a new life.

"﻿Is there such thing as a ""free lunch?"" Are your favorite mobile apps really free?

As Milton Friedman said, there is no such thing as a free lunch. In digital time, similarly, seemingly cost-free mobile apps are far away from being truly free.
From the developers who designed seeming cost-free apps point of view, developing and maintaining apps involves significant time, resources and expertise. If those apps are free for users, how do the developers pay for the efforts people made. 
Generally, seemingly cost-free apps depend on advertising. Advertisers pay app developers to display advertisements to users. For example, sometimes, when launching an app, you may have to watch an advertisement popularizing other apps before entering the interface of the app you wants. 
Another common strategy is advanced functions. For some basic functions, people are able to use them for free. However, from time to time, such basic functions can not meet people's needs. Then it is a time for them to purchase advanced services to meet certain specific demands. This strategy provides basic functions for people to attract more users. It also encourages people to pay for advanced functions

"﻿Evaluate the accuracy of this statement: ""Women make $0.80 for every dollar earned by men.""
In popular belief, working women often face the gender pay gap and get lower salaries compared to men. That's true, but the statement ""Women make $0.80 for every dollar earned by men""does not completely represent the reality. Women in the same positions as men are paid the same wages. 
The disparities occur in the choice of jobs. In general, women clutter in occupations that are low paid, such as healthcare and education. They have difficulties to get senior positions, particularly in administrative and executive roles. Furthermore, promotion is harder to realize for female. When pregnant and give birth to babies, they would take maternity leaves and scale back their working hours to be child carers. The work-life balance problem seems not highly afflict fathers because their partners tip the scale.
These factors contribute to women earning less than men overall. But just comparing the average wages of both genders is not meaningful.
